32,en,1,805,1,0.937065,positive,,positive,0.930899,"Thanks, Jean, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another record-breaking quarter to finish fiscal 2020, capping off the best full year results in our 38-year history. This year we surpassed $1.8 billion in top line sales and increase adjusted EBITDA by over 56% to $300 million. These results were achieved in a year of unprecedented challenges and demonstrates the strength of our business model and the extraordinary execution of our team. They truly went above and beyond leveraging many years of experience and long-standing relationships in the closeout industry to secure the very best deals for our customers. This response and know-how is our secret sauce. It drives our success and shows the flexibility of our business model and nimble operational capabilities."
33,en,1,402,1,0.955709,positive,,positive,0.963554,"I would like to express my sincere thanks to the entire Ollie's family, who demonstrated their dedication and resiliency during these challenging times. Since the outset of the pandemic, our priorities have been consistent, ensure the health and safety of our team members and customers, support our communities, and provide our customers with a steady flow of extraordinary deals, and items they need."
34,en,1,155,1,0.94211,positive,,positive,0.94211,"Great deal flow across all departments, productive new stores and strong comparable store sales drove a 22% increase in our top line in the fourth quarter."
35,en,1,471,1,0.739017,positive,,positive,0.737428,"Comp store sales increased 8.8%. As you may recall, our comp trends are running in the low-single digits early in the quarter and we saw momentum build as we progressed through the holiday season and into January. We continued to benefit from spending trends that worked in our favor with a shift in demand for merchandise that appealed to a stay-at-home lifestyle. In January, we believe the second round of government stimulus also fueled some of the comp sales growth."
36,en,1,138,1,0.767962,positive,,positive,0.767962,"Our top-line growth, combined with our gross margin expansion and expense control, drove adjusted net income growth of 31% in the quarter."
37,en,1,835,1,0.868124,positive,,positive,0.861586,"We're very happy with, with the broad-based strength across our merchandise categories with over two thirds of our departments comping positive. Our top performing categories included bed and bath, housewares, flooring, food, health, and beauty aids, and seasonal. We executed the Ollie's formula, buy cheap and sell cheap. And we had the right products at a great value. Deal flow remains very strong and we are excited about what we are seeing in the marketplace with great deals presented to us every day. The merchant team continues to leverage longstanding vendor partnerships and establish new vendor relationships to capture incredible deals across all merchandise categories. Our ability to capitalize on these opportunities in the current retail landscape has never been better as we continue to leverage our increasing scale."
38,en,1,516,1,0.793404,positive,,positive,0.832087,"We have a proven ability to handle large deals from our suppliers and an exceptionally strong liquidity position. We are pleased with our current inventory position ending the quarter with inventories up 5.5% compared to last year. Our continued sales velocity has us chasing the business a little, but as I mentioned, deal flow remains as strong as ever. As you heard me say before, our approach to maintaining dry powder and our open-to-buy gives us the flexibility to ramp up receipts and opportunistic purchases."
39,en,1,702,1,0.879906,positive,,positive,0.869427,"We can also respond quickly to changing consumer demands. All this plays for our strengths, our aggressiveness and agility as an organization. The strong deal flow is always driving great new store performance. New stores once again, delivered sales above our expectations with our recent store classes across new states and new markets outperforming our model. We opened a total of 46 new stores in 2020, and I am very proud of the team's ability to execute these projects despite the added complexities of operating and opening during the pandemic. New stores remain the primary driver of our growth. And we – excuse me, see great opportunities to continue to expand our footprint in 2021 and beyond."
40,en,1,297,1,0.653718,positive,,positive,0.626623,"We are targeting 50 store openings this year, including three to four relocations and are planning to introduce the Ollie's brand to three new states, Kansas, Missouri, and Vermont. So far this year we've opened seven stores, including one relocation and we’re very pleased with the early results."
41,en,1,383,1,0.840463,positive,,positive,0.840144,"We have a tremendous runway for growth, with the potential to expand our store base to over 1050 locations nationwide. We feel good about the significant white space and the availability of high-quality sites. The value-driven consumers clearly is not going away and by most measures value is gaining in importance. With this in mind, we feel very confident in our runway for growth."
42,en,1,640,1,0.546026,positive,1,positive,0.555091,"Ollie’s Army continued to be a significant sales driver in the fourth quarter and membership keeps growing. We ended the period with over 11.6 million active members, a 13.6% increase over the prior year with growth in the membership levels, outpacing store growth. Army members shop our stores more often and drive a substantially larger basket. Ollie's Army sales comprised of over 75% of our total sales in both the quarter and the year, representing the highest sales penetration ever. Clearly, these are very important customers with whom we look to build long-lasting relationships through special benefits and of course, great deals."
43,en,1,396,1,0.858034,positive,,positive,0.838098,"As we shared with you last quarter, we on the early stages of enhancing our marketing programs and redeploying dollars to optimize their effectiveness. Our focus is twofold, deepen engagement with existing customers and attract new customers. We are pleased with what we are seeing so far, and we will continue to refine our efforts, particularly regarding new digital initiatives in fiscal 2021."
44,en,1,491,1,0.873028,positive,,positive,0.874457,"We are very excited about our results for the quarter and the continued momentum of the business. Comp stores sales growth is tracking in the high-single digits quarter-to-date. We are pleased with our current sales trends that we believe we are well positioned to deliver solid first quarter results. As a reminder, we anniversary the onset of last year’s COVID demand surge in mid-April and it’s from that point forward that we’ll be up against very challenging year-over-year comparisons."
45,en,1,411,1,0.798472,positive,,positive,0.850233,"Like everyone, we look forward to putting the pandemic behind us, but we undoubtedly will be dealing with the opportunities and challenges in fiscal 2021 that like last year, will have varying degrees of impact on the economy, consumers and our business. No matter what comes, we’re going to keep doing what we do best. Buy and sell good stuff cheap, while maintaining discipline in how we operate the business."
46,en,1,458,1,0.832512,positive,,positive,0.840844,"As Mark would say, we're hitting all of our marks, we are offering incredible deals, controlling expenses and opening successful new stores. Simply said, our team knows how to execute our strategy and deliver results in both good and bad economic periods and we believe we’re well positioned to benefit from the continued disruption in the marketplace. Looking ahead, our long-term growth algorithm remains intact and I am bullish as ever about our business."
47,en,1,380,1,0.880896,positive,,positive,0.883105,"We delivered unbelievable results in the quarter and in the year, and I could not be prouder to be part of this team. I want to thank our almost 9,500 team members for their incredible dedication and contributions to the business, particularly during these challenging times. As we say, we are Ollie’s. I’ll now hand the call over to Jay to take you through our financial results."

I want to start by thanking the entire Ollie’s team for their tireless efforts and teamwork in a year unlike any other in our history. Despite the numerous challenges, you consistently stepped up to drive business and meet the customer’s needs. I appreciate all that you do."
50,en,1,653,1,0.91443,positive,,positive,0.885144,"We are very pleased to have delivered a record quarter in fiscal year. For the quarter net sales increased 22.1% to $515.8 million. Great deal flow, productive new stores and strong comps drove this increase. Comparable store sales increased 8.8% in the quarter fueled by a significant increase in average basket, partially offset by fewer transactions. We ended the quarter with 388 stores in 25 States a 12.5% year-over-year increase in store count with a total of 46 new stores for the year. These stores are the engine of our growth and we are very pleased with their productivity and ROI as our new stores pay for themselves in less than two years."
51,en,1,718,1,0.240804,positive,1,negative,-0.293211,"Gross profit increased 23.6% to $204.7 million and gross margin increased 50 basis points to 39.7%. The increase in margin was due to improvement in the merchandise margin and leveraging of supply chain costs. SG&A expenses, excluding insurance gains in both the current and prior year increased 20% to $114.4 million primarily due to additional selling expenses from our new stores, higher store payroll to support the increase in sales and increased incentive compensation. SG&A as a percentage of net sales, excluding the insurance gains decreased 40 basis points to 22.2%. The decrease was driven by leveraging occupancy and many other costs due to our strong sales performance and continued tight expense control."
52,en,1,520,1,0.729251,positive,,positive,0.81779,"Adjusted operating income, which excludes the gain from the insurance settlements increased 31.7% to $84.5 million. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 16.4%. Adjusted net income, which excludes tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the after-tax insurance gain increased 31% to $63.8 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31.1% to $0.97 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased 32.9% to $92.1 million and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter."
53,en,1,652,1,0.45696,positive,1,positive,0.640963,"In 2020 net sales increased 28.4% to $1.809 billion and comparable store sales increased 15.6% for the year. Adjusted net income in 2020 increased 61.1% to $208 million and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 61.2% to $3.16. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $306.5 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.9% for the year. Capital expenditures in 2020 totaled $30.5 million compared with $77 million in the prior year. Last year expenditures included approximately $43 million for the construction of the Texas DC. At the end of the period, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $100 million revolving credit facility and $447 million in cash."
54,en,1,622,1,0.926668,positive,,positive,0.926053,"In 2020, we generated over $361 million in operating cash flows. Our proven track record of robust cash flow generation as a testament to the strength of our model, allowing us to fund our growth and continue to build our cash position. This year, we planned to strategically deploy our cash on hand to buy back shares of our stock in both a programmatic and opportunistic manner, putting our cash to good use and increasing shareholder value. As you saw in our press release, the Board recently authorized a $100 million increase in our share buyback program resulting in over $200 million approved for share repurchases."
55,en,1,589,1,0.62174,positive,1,positive,0.616073,"While we are optimistic about the momentum of our business, there remains uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its potential impacts on the economy, the consumer and our 2021 results. For these reasons, we will not be providing specific guidance at this time, but I will share some high-level thoughts on fiscal 2021. As John indicated, we’re off to a good start with comps tracking in the high-single digits. We continue to operate in an uncertain environment, including the timing and duration of stimulus spending, inflation and evolving consumer behavior as we emerge from the pandemic."
56,en,1,544,1,0.861295,positive,,positive,0.809056,"As you know, we’re up against exceptionally strong numbers and strong comps in 2020 with the initial COVID related sales surge beginning in mid-April. The second quarter will certainly be our most difficult comparison, both from a sales and net income standpoint, given our incredible performance in 2020. The third and fourth quarter comparisons will be challenging as well as we continue to perform at unprecedented levels and saw top-line benefits from economic stimulus. Under normal circumstances we would not expect to comp these numbers."
57,en,1,571,1,-0.345285,negative,1,positive,0.426769,"We are anticipating some headwinds in gross margin due to ongoing supply chain pressures impacting all retailers, such as increased important trucking costs. We expect a headwind of approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year, taking us from our typical target of 40% gross margin to 39.7% to 39.8% for the year. In addition to these increased costs, we are currently seeing increased port congestion, which could create delays in certain imported product categories. However, as always disruption of this nature may lead to opportunities down the road."
58,en,1,653,1,0.850788,positive,,positive,0.944699,"Finally, SG&A, as you know we have and always will keep a tight rein on our expenses, however even with the continued prudent approach to expense management, we are facing very challenging comparisons given the leverage we achieved in 2020. We expect to return to more historical norms in our SG&A expense rate for 2021. Our current plans include the following, the opening of 50 stores including three to four relocations. We’re planning a split of approximately 50:50 in openings between the first and second halves of the year. We feel confident that we can achieve our target, but we will be dependent on local market conditions to stay on schedule."
59,en,1,792,1,0.826332,positive,,positive,0.848417,"We expect capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million, primarily for new stores, IT projects and store level initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in the range of $26 million to $27 million, excluding – including approximately $6 million that runs through cost of goods sold. And effective tax rate of 25.2% which excludes the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 66.6 million before any impact from stock buybacks. While challenges remain in 2021, opportunities also exist. The strength of our model in both strong and weak economic cycles, our very strong financial position and our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm have us excited as ever for the future."

Maybe any early takeaways from this round of stimulus versus the round a year ago? And when it’s all said and done, I mean, do you believe this pandemic will ultimately prove additives to Ollie’s brand awareness or market share? Just kind of trying to think about the model on the other side as we approach the end, hopefully of this pandemic?"

67,en,1,412,1,0.745291,positive,,negative,-0.348416,"Sure, Matt. I would say, from what we can see, obviously it’s very, very early on and what I would call the third stimulus package that just came out starting Friday, Saturday of this past week, but the behaviors are really resembling what we saw on the stimulus one and two, relative to the immediate response to our – at least our model, we’re seeing some, some pretty nice benefits from what people are doing."
68,en,1,313,1,0.73164,positive,,positive,0.665894,"I do believe that we will see some continued benefits all the way through probably mid-part of April until we go up against the first stimulus that was introduced last year. So, we’ll have some headwinds at that point in time, but I think we have some pretty good runway from now until the [middle of] [ph] April."

So, I think that we will have some stickiness with those folks and that should be a benefit for us on a long-term basis."

I’m curious, how your – my guess is you’re probably chasing inventory now, but then as we think about going up against some of these tougher compares, just how are you planning inventory between near-term and back half of the year? And last, just on that point, as we think about your backend model from a merchandise margin opportunity on the buying front, does this provide you some level of insulation as we think about the freight headwind that I know you’re facing as well?"

73,en,1,643,1,0.629193,positive,1,positive,0.66049,"Yes. Matt, I would tell you we are having no problems whatsoever, securing product in great brands and great names at great prices. It’s actually been better than I would have expected at this point in time. And it’s very broad based, it’s not one category or two categories we’re seeing in every single category, which is a little earlier than I would’ve expected. Our merchants are appropriately bought up and they’re in great shape from an open-to-buy perspective. But we are not in any way, shape or form having problems getting inventory purchased from our manufacturers and our relationships. So, from that perspective, I’m very excited."
74,en,1,277,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"And I think it’s only going to get better in the remainder part of the year.

I would tell you the answer on that is, we always are going to get back to the consumer where we can and try to maintain our 40-point gross margin.

I was hoping you could tease that out a little bit more and maybe on that note, wondering if there's any consideration to your go-to market strategy with advertising, which has been heavily print dominant in the past.

I think 2009 you comped at 8% and then 2010 was a flat, to your stack of plus 8%, is that maybe some type of framework we could think about for this year or do you just see too many differences with what's going on now versus back then?"

We obviously had a heck of a last year, so we wouldn't expect the comp at negative 8% as a rational way to think about it. The other way, from a framework standpoint, how we think about it a little bit as if we look at 2019 our normal top line growth rate is call it 14% to 15%. So, if we have two years of that from 2019 grow top line 30%, and that might get you in the ballpark, but again, we're not giving guidance, but trying to just give a framework for a kind of a base model."

The challenges are actually less than what they used to be is we're a lot cleaner. We don't have the challenges of top stocking, goods being stuck on the shelves for an extended period of time.

There's always going to be close outs regardless of what people think and how they view the world, there's package change, there's obsolescence that happens, there's shelf pools. I mentioned this a few calls ago that close outs could create in many different ways, just as there may be shortages of the inline product, it doesn't mean there's not close out availability.

We have not changed our business strategy one bit."

I'm sorry to like keep going back to the inventory side, but when we look at a per store basis, it seems pretty lean. Could you just talk about it?

So, I think reducing the levels from where we were previously is, we're spot on where we'd like to be.

The only caveat to that is we did buy a ton of PPE that would – some of them might have been closed up but multi was not closed out. So that would have impacted our overall closeout mixed somewhere down close to 66% of our overall purchases, PPE that we purchased. But we believe we'll be back to the 70% here in 2021. And that is something that's not a problem for us. I don't foresee us buying as nearly as much PP this year as we did last year, but the overall mix of 70% close outs, I believe, is a good number for us, and then 18% on the everyday value goods and 12% on the imports is about where we think we'll be."

So, there's definitely a very large disparity this year versus last year in terms of where Q2 is going to be for those of us that were open during the pandemic and for those of us that generate a 43% comp, that's going to be – that number is a big number to even dream of bound comping."

But what we did see, which was interesting is we still got the traction in the stores it may not happen in that one day, but it still happened pretty quickly where the store has still performed very, very well.

You can kind of back into probably the split between comp and non-comp. We've got the margin of 39.7%, 39.8%, SG&A levels of more normalized call it 25%, little bit north of there."

And of course, we're going work hard to do better than to do the best we can, not turn off the registers like Mark would say. And we've been pretty successful at that. But again, these, yes, trying to comp a year like last year is just not something that Ollie's is built for."

First, on the user front, although, the pandemic in the first half of the year brought us large scale users to consume pandemic-related needs and hot trends, it had a negative impact on the content generation of entertainment vertical and certain other areas such as, tourism and sports, which resulted in less user engagement in this sector."

However, with a well-controlled pandemic situation and the recovery of the ad demand, Weibo's social marketing value proposition earned wider recognition among brand customers, leveraging our unique marketing offerings such as hot trends, celebrity and KOL marketing, as well as brand price performance solution. As a result, our brand ad revenues delivered a solid rebound in the second half of this year and achieved double-digit growth year-over-year in Q4 with number of branding customers spending with us setting a new record."

363,en,1,567,1,0.877067,positive,,positive,0.837869,"Next, let me share some color on our progress in product and monetization in Q4, as well as layout key initiatives for 2021. On the product front, starting from Q4 last year, we further enhanced Weibo's differentiated competitiveness in hot trend and social attributes. Coupled with efficient channel strategies, we stabilized our user scale and further drove user engagement. Concurrently we also beefed up our investment in the video sector to strengthen users' mind set of using Weibo for video consumption so as to enhance our competitiveness in user acquisition."
364,en,1,690,1,0.781999,positive,,positive,0.779435,"On the channel front, in Q4, we optimized channel strategy for new and recalled users combined with hot trend and topic products.

To elaborate, we focus on improving user experience in relationship-based feeds to data mining and quality social content based on several dimensions, such as intimacy of social relations, frequency of visits, and amount of discussion by followers, et cetera. With such quality content offer, we could further deepen their consumption, as well as enhance user retention."

As a result, the effective time spend per user on a post really recommendation feed increased over 30% and the effect of video views posted each recommendation increased over 10%, compared with Q3."

We seek to extend user base and engagement from the following three aspects. First, on the channel investment, leveraging our competitive advantage in these acquisition costs will ensure channel investments through traditional channels, and focus more on channel investment to improve user engagement, while strengthening the synergy between channel investments, and subsequent content consumption, and thereby increasing user engagement and retention."

The rapid recovery of KA business in the second half of the year were mainly driven by the following factors; first of all, from the perspective of the market environment most industry sectors have returned to normal operation in the second half of the year and gradually resumed ad replacement except for few sectors such as entertainment tourism. That has not fully recovered from the pandemic. And meanwhile, the pandemic has further driven ad budget shift from offline to online. We saw top brand customers and also those emerging brands embracing Internet platforms as their major campaign arena."
375,en,1,234,1,0.589698,positive,,positive,0.524936,"Secondly, KA clients have shifted more of their budget from TV and long-form video platform to social and short-video platform and lowering the user engagement shift. With this trend, social platform had more strength in KA marketing."

So first of all, in 2020 Q4, we have been seeing a very good recovery of our KA ad customer, especially we returned to the triple-digit growth. And also, we although had a year-on-year decrease on SME in Q4, but still that particular decrease rate has been reduced.

And also, talking about the other, traffic diverting related SMEs, without a very strong demand on branding, actually in 2020, we were talking about those O2O or e-commerce businesses. We had a little bit -- another ideal performance in 2020, but still in 2021, we are going to see a further intense competition in the area that I mentioned."

We do see that those customers from OTV actually had a very high requirement already kind of a content, and also the IP as well as the famous KOLs in this area. So based on the unique advantage of Weibo in terms of the IP and KOLs, and celebrities, we are very much positive to actually have the advantage of those OTV converted or transferred budgets and gaining that."

Our successful pivot to SUI in 2020 was fostered by many important milestones that were achieved. These include the positive preclinical and SUI feasibility study results reported, positive data that validated our new inner sham treatment tip that produces no tissue, nor clinical benefit, FDA approval of the strengthened PURSUIT trial investigational device exemption, formation of our preeminent clinical advisory board and incontinence, and the issuance of a newly issued U.S., SUI method patent."

It feels like there's some upside that this had on the utilization in the revenues. Could you call that out as far as geographies that you're seeing recently and obviously we don't expect any guidance, but it feels like at the moment ‘21 could be guided into ‘20 on the top line, at least from how we are looking at it?"

You know 2020 was obviously difficult, particularly in the United States where the Asia Pacific region recovered far more quickly in 2020 and actually contributed quite strongly to the 2020 results. But here at the beginning, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and 2021, I think it's – we are certain the market is improving, we're certainly seeing clinics that had to close down in 2020, re-open up, order tips, start to treat patients, see and improve patient flow. So we're optimistic that we're on the up-tick here and that should translate into a better year for us from a financial perspective."

We’ve worked hard as you know over the last 18 months or so to sort of reduce the cash burn and start to level set the financial statements and improve just operational efficiency. And so we're going to continue to improve that as we go into 2021 and while we’ll see an uptick in 2021 on the R&D line due to the trial being mostly conducted this year, you know these are tremendously expensive trials and so it won't be significant."

559,en,1,590,1,0.590068,positive,,positive,0.683646,"Yeah, I think it's fair to say, you know we're at where we expect it to be. It's always a ramp up when you begin and we began – we announced enrollment on January ’21, so it's been a little less than two months here. And then it tends to accelerate as you get all the sites up and screening and treating patients and dealing with the flow through of the various advertising campaigns that are going on locally around each of our clinic sites. And so you know right now we feel like we're on track to hit our enrollment target of the end of the second quarter or you know very early in July."

We knew we were going to face certain challenges coming into the execution of the trial from enrollment and follow-up perspective in this environment, but I think we learned a lot in 2020 having run the feasibility study and you know try to incorporate those learning’s into this very important study for us and I think we're on track and I expect we'll get you know right up to or at or very near to the 30 site at the end of the day."

565,en,1,248,1,0.790596,positive,,positive,0.876687,Okay. That’s defiantly helpful. And then just looking at some of these secondary endpoints and it looks like you've kind of altered them or at least a couple few on them since the original trial design came out before you boosted the patient count.
566,en,1,321,1,0.489268,positive,,positive,0.50255,"Can you maybe talk about some of these secondary end points and you know why you add some, or simple ones that are chosen. I mean it seems like there are few that maybe could help us kind of get the patient guidance on when they could expect the results, or was that a consideration. What went into some of these changes?"

568,en,1,407,1,0.971769,positive,,positive,0.971769,"Yeah, I think the most important change is really the addition of the three month time point and that was really done for precisely the reason you just highlighted, which is you know if as we expect sort of to get to a positive outcome from this trial, it will be important from there as we achieve an FDA clearance and begin to be able to finally market on-label in the United States and elsewhere for SUI."
569,en,1,937,1,0.823442,positive,,positive,0.823442,"That you know physicians have a sense for the on-set of improvement in symptoms or leakage and by adding the three month end-point it really gives a nice time history of improvement, because we can look back at voiding episodes, we can look at mean change from baseline on the Pad Weight Test in addition to responder rates, and really get a sense of the time sequence of outcome and that can be communicated to patients once we're on a label from the physician in terms of setting expectations. Because as you know, ours is a tissue mechanism of action that based on our history in the many clinical trials we've run and the sort of vast commercial experience we have today, we know that it takes 30 to 90 days for the tissues to remodel and for women to start seeing clinical improvement in their symptoms. And so that's the main change to – is really adding the three month time point to the pad Weight Tests and to the voiding diary."

571,en,1,313,1,0.345831,positive,1,positive,0.266205,"Got it. That makes a lot of sense and then, obviously SUI is an embracement conditions. So it makes sense that people are suffering from it or are kind of reluctant to discuss and that's why you get that kind of broad spectrum of estimates in terms of you know what's the number of women in the U.S. that have it."
572,en,1,333,1,-0.492989,negative,1,negative,-0.338343,"But I did notice, it sounds like you're looking more at 25 million to 30 million based upon some of the prepared remarks, where you said in the press release, whereas like we caught you previously talking more or less kind of the 11 million range. Is that maybe including a little bit more of a mixed UI or why the higher figure now."

574,en,1,453,1,0.573693,positive,,positive,0.9554,"Yeah so, it’s a great question and thanks for asking it, because I think it's important to clarify that when we talk about you know 25 million to 30 million women in the U.S. with you know with stress incontinence, its was some form of stress incontinence and as you know there's pure stress incontinence, there is pure urge incontinence and then there is this enormous population of patients who have a little bit of both, which they refer to as mixed."
575,en,1,679,1,0.558293,positive,,positive,0.339045,"And so when we talk about 25 million to 30 million women in the United States have some form of stress urinary incontinence, it's including pure SUI and most of the mix patience. But as you drill down on that and really what we're focused on, you know with stress in particular is making sure we're identifying patients who have predominant SUI, and so when we talk about 10 million or 11 million 12 million of those patients who would be candidates for as of the procedure, we're really honing in on those patients who are predominantly SUI and there are a variety of clinical mechanisms to differentiate whether a patient has more stress incontinence or more urge incontinence."

I'm looking forward to updates this year. Could you just maybe walk me through the timing perhaps between the bal BLA filing, and when you actually anticipate submitting the combo and perhaps when ultimate approval is perhaps expected there? And then second, just if you could talk through perhaps some of your go-to-market efforts to this point and any goals for the remainder of this year, and if there's any color on discussions with payers or thoughts on pricing that would be great. Thank you."

As you know and as we sort of alluded to, as data matures, looking at our past performance with data disclosures, we're delighted to see that the data is getting better. And I think given the size of our company and given the enormous demands on us for regulatory undertakings, we’ve made a decision several months ago which we articulated to the investment community that our first priority is to file our BLA with balstilimab. And once that's done, we will provide additional guidance for our timelines associated with our bal/zal filing. And of course, that will include disclosure of more mature data which we're in the process of addressing both from a public disclosure perspective as well as disclosing it to the agency."

We're really evaluating how we're going to really address the unmet needs in the marketplace and position this product in a way that addresses those unmet needs both at a physician level as well as on a patient level."
707,en,1,405,1,0.739727,positive,,positive,0.749921,"At the patient level, you bring up the question on pricing and access, that’s going to be one of our absolute paramount priorities is just to ensure unencumbered access to balstilimab, as we look at the landscape that that's going to follow. We look at this as a pivotal part in our relationship with payers because we don't believe this is going to be, of course, our first and only into the marketplace."
708,en,1,495,1,0.799646,positive,,positive,0.783517,"We want to be able to follow on with other products, and establishing those relationships and making sure that they understand our goals, which is unencumbered patient access is going to be really key. So, we're going to be starting those discussions with payers. We've done a lot of market research to understand really what are the drivers to position our product, and we're really encouraged by what we're hearing to be able to offer that in a setting both at the physician and patient level."

Just wanted to know if we can anticipate perhaps a robust clinical update on that perhaps later this year, and if we’ll maybe get us a look at that Phase 2 data in colorectal? Thanks."

Appreciate the comprehensive update and thanks for taking my questions, and great to have Dr. O'Day and Andy be part of the discussion. So maybe just piggybacking on the previous question on the upcoming 1181 clinical data at AACR, would you also have more updated cutoff relative to February 9? Could you just clarify that? And maybe Dr. O'Day if you could comment on why MSS colorectal indication kind of makes the first to pursue as you think about fast [ph] to market? Can you just talk about the dynamics of that indication?"

At AACR, yes, we will have a more mature data than what we've previously disclosed, and this will include more information on duration as well as potential new responses in the program too. Now, I'll turn it over to Dr. O'Day to give you his thinking on MSS colorectal cancer."

721,en,1,361,1,0.847481,positive,,positive,0.954513,"Thank you Mayank. Well, as Jenny said, I'm new to the company in recent months, but I have had the unique opportunity to be involved with 1181 over the course of the last several years both in learning about its exciting clinical drug design as well as pre-clinical data and then obviously being involved as the principal investigator in the 1181 Phase 1 trial."
722,en,1,219,1,0.724619,positive,,positive,0.724619,"What's exciting to me is the pre-clinical data of more activity and T-reg depletion, as well as more potential access to low affinity CD16 alleles all seems to be playing out so far in the clinic with our Phase I trial."
723,en,1,297,1,-0.514451,negative,,negative,-0.514451,"As you can imagine, with the competitive nature and approvals across I-O indications in solid tumors, Phase I trials attract fairly cold tumors that are MS-stable and there's no surprise that our trial has attracted those patients, particularly colorectal endometrial MS stable ovarian and others."
724,en,1,311,1,-0.597398,negative,,negative,-0.597398,"And what's exciting to me is to see objective responses, obviously in both 1181 monotherapy in combinations in these cold tumors that are predominantly PD-L1 negative MS stable low tumor burden, and interestingly, in CD16 lower heterozygous affinity polymorphisms, which is all consistent with preclinical data."
725,en,1,219,1,0.382504,positive,1,positive,0.379206,"So given that fact, obviously, I'm excited to be part of the development of this drug as we go forward. And colorectal MS stable cohorts are clearly a huge unmet need with a low bar in the second and third-line setting."
726,en,1,407,1,0.563325,positive,1,positive,0.563325,"So, we're going to follow the data and expand these cohorts in cold tumors as well as look at our warm-to-hot tumors, both lung and then cutaneous tumors, melanoma, and non-melanoma cutaneous skin tumors are real opportunities for us to look both at this agent and single agent as well as combination. So, it's going to be exciting coming year for me and my clinical team to develop this very exciting drug."

Jen, what would be the path for QS-21 just from a clinical development standpoint? And also on the TIGIT bispecific, when do you expect disclosing the other target you're working on?"
729,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Jennifer Buell
730,en,1,444,1,0.729645,positive,,positive,0.92663,"So Mayank, I’m here. So let me start with TIGIT disclosing. As you can imagine, this is an incredibly competitive space. We have a bispecific that is a first of its kind we believe and it's designed really to address an entirely new area. So we will not be disclosing that anytime soon, but we'll certainly keep you informed as the data continue to progress both preclinically and then clinically and that may drive our decision on disclosures."
731,en,1,418,1,0.782313,positive,,positive,0.834159,"For QS-21, the development is really straightforward. So as you know, Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in our initiative to advance a sustainable supply of QS-21. We've done so we're in the process of doing so, but we've already generated early data and demonstrated the bio-comparability of this new supply compared to the previous clinic version, which is now in the approved Shingrix vaccine as you know."
732,en,1,844,1,0.581505,positive,1,positive,0.548403,"So the development is straightforward. It's preclinical comparability. And then the clinical program will be very abbreviated to bring this product into market with a number of vaccine products underway. And particularly, at this time when we see the criticality of effective vaccines, we know that historical vaccines no longer cut it. Flu vaccines at 30% efficacy just won't do it. So we need to improve our ability to take antigens allow for mass global production of those and this is where QS-21 is really critical at antigen sparing allowing a fewer number or lower amount of antigens to actually be quite effective. As you see with Shingrix, it's over 90%, up to 97% effective in adults and gets better with age. These are the kinds of findings that we're going to need across the board as we deal with these mutating viruses repeatedly."

Understood. Then, last for Garo, as you think about the cash accretive transactions, just can you just high level talk to the framework that you guys are kind of evaluating internally. When you think about prosecuting these opportunities across the board more advanced late-stage versus earlier stage programs? Kind of, how do you think about a lot of push and pull that might be associated with these transactions?"

I just wanted to start with OTC Link - we obviously really great in the quarter. We talked in the past about kind of you got a certain amount or a finite amount of growth to go after there?"
825,en,1,325,1,0.988088,positive,,positive,0.988088,"I guess can you just talk about where you're at in terms of the market share, the gains on market share where that can go from here? And then also, I think you announced also the NQB how does that change. Does that open up additional market share opportunities with Link you could just help me with that a little bit? Thanks."

829,en,1,429,1,0.931422,positive,,positive,0.921351,"Yes, so Chris, thank you for that question. I look at it is the impressive part volumes are something we don't fully control in the market. But what's been more impressive is the continuing subscriber, the subscriber growth for OTC Link ECN. And that is something that the team did a fantastic job throughout 2020 and has continued to do that. And then, you can take a look at a limited functionality for a certain type of trade."
830,en,1,536,1,0.752516,positive,1,positive,0.743269,"But going into the space of the anonymous matching engine model which is a tool to access liquidity and deliver best execution the broker-dealer desire, is what the other tools for us to add on top of that. And this skill set in this space is and the ability to on-board new clients is a skill set that if we have a strong P, and we can deliver. And this is really important technology to broker dealers at a competitive cost, because both in the exchange phase and some other ATS’ in non-equity assets. The things are pretty expensive."
831,en,1,484,1,0.88709,positive,,positive,0.82189,"So if we're good at being a cost effective, very useful client focused vendor, we'll find opportunities. On NCB, it’s - there is restrictions on how we can distribute our quote data if we're anonymous ECN, OTC Link. So it's a third business model which is electronic match, electronic [Autolex] of orders, but fully disclosed. And that creates a data feed for us which makes our models better because we're putting the data out further and wider the depth of book not just the inside."
832,en,1,310,1,0.482905,positive,1,positive,0.541588,"And it creates some system reliability resilience. And it gives a third model for broker-dealers who want to be fully disclosed, but don't want to put more liquidity on top of the execution. And what you really need to understand is, different broker dealers have different needs based on their business model."
833,en,1,277,1,0.946133,positive,,positive,0.944942,"And we want to provide the tools and infrastructure across our platform to fit and make successful all different models of brokerage.

And I guess just turning to 15c2-11, and it's like - to support initiatives, you’re going to have to invest a little bit. Is that correct in kind of reading what you've put in the annual report that - do you need to make a bigger investment this year to support changes around 15c2-11?"
836,en,1,296,1,0.852883,positive,,positive,0.902192,"And then, I guess just what are the opportunities, are you excited about on-boarding newer companies coming onto your markets or has this made you think about maybe investing in other areas of the business to maybe support growth if some of it hit. Can you just walk me through that a little bit?"

838,en,1,426,1,0.697706,positive,,positive,0.56578,"Well, 15c2-11 is the big transformation in 2021. And it takes us from offering a regulated trading platform business under Reg ATS. And having market data, which investors and brokers use to analyze value and trade securities and our corporate services business, which has been market-driven. We built that whole business based on companies wanting to step-up and really own their trading to provide the information out there."
839,en,1,411,1,0.929141,positive,,positive,0.913773,"So, investors are informed and brokers can best most efficiently trade securities. However, the markets move forward in 15c2-11 has recognized that we are the ones in the OTC market who set the standard for monitoring what level of disclosure and compliance and governance companies put out there. And this has been recognized, has been continually recognized by the states as they recognized just for Blue Sky."
840,en,1,469,1,0.629321,positive,,positive,0.758045,"So there's one part that's really important is, we are moving to be seen as the entity that broker dealers can rely on for monitoring ongoing disclosure by issuers that there's current information as publicly available and ongoing and that's important. The second side is that it is because for the monitoring piece, the ongoing disclosure we're about halfway there. The market recognized it and then the regulators are catching up is that the onboarding is - exciting."
841,en,1,453,1,0.426188,positive,1,positive,0.417838,"It is really painful and complicated to bring a company onto our markets because you had a broker dealer filing a 211 and with FINRA, the FINRA information was hidden - in FINRA investors didn't see it. And it's a change to what really should be done today is making sure that there's adequate current information publicly available when a security industry is trading. So it's a big piece for us to one, create the regulatory compliance infrastructure."
842,en,1,395,1,0.456286,positive,,positive,0.804484,"But on the other side is, where's the commercial value, because today when a company would become trade at OTC. There wasn't a great ability for other broker dealers to see the information or understand the level of compliance, the financial strength, what - the securities issuance history, all - these pieces of information that brokers need to trade a security and put it out into the market."
843,en,1,303,1,0.800231,positive,,positive,0.815688,"And so, what we look at is 15c2-11 is providing the regulatory foundation for changing how companies can go public on our markets. But we're going to build a commercial structure that gives value both to companies and broker dealers to make, going public on our markets much more valuable and efficient."

But just on the M&A opportunity to talk, you know in the annual report, you see 2021 as - maybe a bigger year. I think it is the last acquisition in 1980s and [1990s] if I remember right around - the conference if I remember right?"

And so, and we have a big internal project with 15c2-11. So we want to for the long-term and I think hiring of Antonia demonstrates where we want to go for the longer term. But in the short-term we want to focus on our organic opportunities is, and but we will."

And increase the - our per share earnings power, which is as I think about it over the long-term, we want to grow, the pre-tax earnings or EBITDA of just the ability to earn per share.

853,en,1,230,1,0.800943,positive,,positive,0.296934,"And then on the consolidated audit trail, that I think next phase, that becomes effective in April. And on both those fronts, I mean can you give any sort of indication in terms of the cost side for the GCM for implementation yet?"

You may have seen the SEC put out a proposed conditional exemption towards the end of 2020 to the expert market with a comment period attached to it. We and several others commented on it and all of, everything in the comment file very positive. That comment file closed about a month ago. And so, we continue to talk to the SEC about it. We are anxious to see it get approved."
856,en,1,406,1,0.73674,positive,1,positive,0.697798,"But it’s - we understand as a commission is in flux a little bit right now, with again they’re still going through the confirmation proceedings in order to potentially the SEC chair. And so, we'd love to see it happen any day now, but do understand that there are other considerations within the commission. The best thing I can say is we have a really good open line of communication with the staff there."
857,en,1,448,1,0.551493,positive,1,positive,0.564844,"And so, we're constantly getting feedback and providing as much information as we can. And we're hopeful that it gets approved sooner rather than later. But we'll certainly be the ones shouting from the mountaintops when it comes out, so we won't be shy about it at all. With respect to CAT, the next phase is to see if CAT becomes effective in April. But CAT has been around for a while and it's only been talked about for a decade, if not longer."
858,en,1,549,1,0.610018,positive,1,positive,0.559533,"And so, the implementation that we focus on is really about supporting our subscribers and their ability to meet their CAT reporting requirements that's something we continue to do. We're meeting with and talking to our subscribers pretty regularly. So it's not about sudden costs, so much as the longer-term plan that we've had in place and the industry has had in place. And similarly it's the same refrain there where we continue to talk to FINRA and the other SROs and the SEC about the ways to right-size how CAT works for our market like ours."

I wonder if you are able to or there is an estimate of how important retail investors are within that. Obviously, you’ve seen a big increase in terms of the market data size, but just wondering on the trading size, how much the high trading volume levels would you say are arising from the retail market?"

863,en,1,448,1,-0.425829,negative,,negative,-0.711623,"So Andrew, the way I look at trading volume is it's something we don't control. We have a diverse group of securities. I mean people pay OTC with low price securities. A lot of the retail speculation has actually been on NYSE and NASDAQ Securities, GameStop, AMC, Hertz. So, and this isn't to say that we don't have those same forces going through. And the debate within the industry is really not is this, a peak volume, but has the floor gone up."
864,en,1,509,1,0.845662,positive,,positive,0.871271,"And has there been more interest in stocks over time and will - and how will, that stay and how will that transform that as investors get smarter. Investors that make mistakes will then be smarter and then they'll seek out other opportunities. They'll do more research. They'll learn like every investors coming to the market. The most successful investors I've ever met have, they talk about their history as early investors of not great, making great investments and then using that to learn and get better."
865,en,1,436,1,0.734107,positive,1,positive,0.732662,"So, we look at it as - the volumes are fantastic. However, and then however, we want to last through both the good market cycles and the bad market cycles. And we built our business around it and we have transaction on subscription business.

But just wondering if that - does that involve higher CapEx than one might have expected prior to the exceptional volumes that have been going on or is that something which - you’re still behaving as a more normal level of investment in the current year?

We exceeded the high end of our guidance with sales volumes of 9,307 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 86% was oil. Contributing to our production outperformance was a continuation of our highly successful workover and reactivation efforts. We also performed 8 CTRs in the fourth quarter, including 4 in the Northwest Shelf and 4 in the Central Basin Platform. Our ongoing CTR program converts wells from electrical submersible pumps to rod pumps, which reduces future overall operating costs and lessens costly workovers."
915,en,1,426,1,0.665849,positive,,positive,0.701046,"During the fourth quarter, we generated $25 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed $13 million of free cash flow during the period, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow. We utilized our free cash flow and the cash on hand to pay down $47 million of bank debt and ended the period with $41 million of liquidity, increasing our liquidity by more than 25% than what we had at the end of the third quarter."
916,en,1,575,1,0.657808,positive,,positive,0.849688,"Finally, with the funds from equity rays and supported by rising oil price environment, in early December, we initiated a targeted Northwest Shelf drilling program that focuses on our highest rate of return inventory. All 4 of the wells drilled in our winter drilling campaign have been completed and are on production. As we noted in our release, the first well we drilled, the Badger 709 B 6XH, is currently producing over 400 barrels of oil a day and is still cleaning up. We are pleased to see initial production results from these 4 wells have exceeded our expectations."
917,en,1,591,1,0.509604,positive,1,positive,0.399687,"Now let's take a look at the full year 2020. Our average sales were 8,790 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 87% was oil. We performed 29 CTRs, including 17 in the Northwest Shelf and 12 in the Central Basin Platform. Our continuing targeted CTR workover and reactivation programs, combined with our ongoing cost optimization initiatives, contributed to a lifting cost of $10.52 per BOE, an 8% decrease year-over-year. We generated $86 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed to $40 million of free cash flow, which we used to help pay down $75 million of bank debt during 2020."

Our SEC proved reserves were comprised of 87% crude oil and 13% natural gas, with 57.5% of total proved reserves classified as proved developed, and the remaining 42.5% as proved undeveloped. Our reserve life ratio based on year-end 2020 SEC proved reserves and 2020 production was 23.8 years. The PV10 of our year-end 2020 SEC proved reserves, taken from our standard measure of future cash flows, was $556 million, which was down 40% from the $923 million at the end of 2019 primarily due to lower prices."

I'm happy to answer any questions on them during our Q&A. As Paul discussed, we were pleased to generate free cash flow once again during the fourth quarter of 2020, our fifth consecutive quarterly period. During 2020, we paid down $75 million on our credit facility, and we will continue to use much of our free cash flow for that purpose. Paul will discuss in more detail in his closing comments, but with the recently initiated targeted drilling program, we are in a stronger position to pay down debt even faster given the high rates of return afforded by our deep inventory of drilling prospects. As we previously announced, in December, we completed our fall bank redetermination, and our borrowing base was set at $350 million. As of December 31, we had $313 million drawn on our credit facility, which resulted in liquidity of $40.6 million, including $37 million available on the revolver and $3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents."

For full year 2021, we anticipate an average -- sorry, yes, 2021, we anticipate an average lifting cost of $0.10 to $10.50 per BOE, which reflects a decrease compared to full year 2020 lifting cost of $10.52 per BOE."

We are targeting total capital spending of $44 million to $48 million, with all expenditures to be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations. In addition to company-directed drilling and completion activities, our capital spending outlook includes targeted well reactivations, workovers, infrastructure upgrades and continuing our successful CTR program in the Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform areas. Also included is anticipated spending for leasing, contractual drilling obligations and non-operated drilling, completion and capital workovers."

Our existing commodity hedges were implemented when prices were lower last year to ensure the necessary cash flow to adhere to these plans.

935,en,1,431,1,0.537916,positive,1,positive,0.48953,"Thank you, Randy. On our third quarter earnings call, I discussed in detail Ring's competitive strengths as well as the challenges we face and how we were addressing them. A lot has changed over the past 4 months since we last spoke, mostly for the better. However, I want to talk a little about the severe winter storm that affected most of the energy industry here in Texas and, more specifically, how it affected our production."
936,en,1,608,1,0.441368,positive,1,positive,0.550294,"We incurred a considerable hit on our production in February, down more than 60% for the majority of the storm. We had an unusual amount of downtime that took us 2 weeks or more to restore. Our first quarter production will be less than what we were originally predicting as a result of this downtime. However, we have restored our production, and with the performance of our new wells and the continued improvements we are seeing in our other initiatives, we will still generate free cash flow for a sixth straight quarter, we will still pay down debt, and we are not going to change our full year guidance."
937,en,1,1131,1,0.978519,positive,,positive,0.981372,"The next thing I want to discuss is our new strategic vision. We are committed to key principles that we are squarely focused on: ensuring health, safety and environmental excellence and a strong commitment to our employees and the communities in which we work and operate; continuing to generate free cash flow to improve and build a sustainable financial foundation; pursuing rigorous capital discipline focused on our highest-returning opportunities; improving margins and driving value by continuously targeting additional operating cost reductions and capital efficiencies; and strengthening our balance sheet by steadily paying down debt, divesting of noncore assets and becoming a peer leader in debt-to-EBITDA metrics. These key principles will continue to guide us, and we are committed to them by pursuing the following 5 strategic objectives: first, we will attract and retain the best people, knowing that our future success can only be achieved through our employees. Second, we will pursue operational excellence with a sense of urgency. This objective is a foundation that will define our culture and future success."
938,en,1,389,1,0.795608,positive,,positive,0.774585,"So what does that mean exactly? We will execute our operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, apply advanced technologies and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash cost on a per-barrel basis. We plan to deliver low-cost, consistent and efficient execution of our drilling campaigns, our work programs and other operations, all with a high sense of urgency."
939,en,1,399,1,0.841695,positive,,positive,0.835645,"An example of this is our highly successful CTR program, which reduces operating expenses and lessens costly workovers. The impact from this program can be seen in the decrease in our lifting cost per BOE from $11.42 in 2019 to $10.52 in 2020. Our confidence in this aspect of our culture is reflected in our forecast of continuing to lower cost this year from anywhere from $0.10 to $10.50 per BOE."
940,en,1,487,1,0.67377,positive,,positive,0.667588,"And yet another example is we relocated our headquarters to the Woodlands and downsized the Midland office, closed our Andrews field office, are in the process of closing the Tulsa office, reducing leasing expenses and resulting in meaningful annual cost savings. But the biggest impact of this change is not the cost savings, it is the consolidation of the executive and management teams, allowing for improved communication, strategizing, execution and continuing to build our culture."
941,en,1,880,1,0.760635,positive,,positive,0.8662,"Moving on to the third strategic objective is to prioritize our work programs and invest in only the highest risk-adjusted rate of return projects in our inventory. This will allow us to profitably grow our production and reserve levels and generate the excess free cash flow we need to pay down debt. We have already discussed our CTR program and our Northwest Shelf drilling program, but both of these demonstrate our commitment to generate as much free cash flow as we can from every dollar we spend. As you know, we drilled 4 Northwest Shelf San Andres horizontal oil wells in December and January, including 3 1.5-mile horizontal wells and 1 1-mile horizontal well. All wells are now completed and producing at various stages of cleanup. Early production results have been at or above expectations, and we look forward to completing the full program over the next few months."
942,en,1,676,1,0.819083,positive,,positive,0.904797,"Moving on to the fourth strategic objective, which is the -- which is to focus on generating free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt. We intend to do this through the use of excess cash from operations and potentially through the proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. Last month, we announced our plan to launch a sales process to divest of our Delaware Basin assets during the second quarter of this year, we are still committed to that plan. Remaining focused and disciplined in this regard will lead to meaningful returns for our shareholders and also provides additional financial flexibility to manage commodity price cycles in the future."
943,en,1,490,1,0.904621,positive,,positive,0.814798,"And moving on to our fifth and final strategic objective is to pursue strategic acquisitions that maintain or reduce our breakeven cost. We will focus on accretive acquisitions, mergers and dispositions that not only improve our breakeven cost but improve our margins, lower our operating costs and are accretive on a cash flow basis. Our financial strategies associated with these efforts will focus on delivering competitive risk- and debt-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders."
944,en,1,803,1,0.852564,positive,,positive,0.872136,"I want to end my prepared comments by, once again, thanking the entire team of Ring employees for their continued hard work and dedication. The past year has clearly been the most challenging in modern times on a global scale, and especially for the oil and gas industry. While I have only been in the company for a little over 5 months, I have quickly come to appreciate the collective determination and dedication of Ring's employees at all levels of the organization. As important, I appreciate the way they have so quickly embraced our new strategic vision, which is evident in our operational and financial results as a direct result of their actions. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our team as we strive to take the company to new heights and further increase shareholder value."

If you recall, we entered the pandemic -- we actually signed a purchase and sale agreement in April of 2020, which probably was right in that peak of the downturn. And so yes, we believe that the prices are better this year. We have also made investments out there to stabilize production, and also we've done a better job of looking at and actually separating out our facilities that are associated with our production and in those portions of our facilities that could be used for commercial saltwater disposal. And so we think that we can get really good value for our assets, and so we're looking forward to doing so this year."

956,en,1,732,1,0.70265,positive,1,positive,0.706259,"Yes. Very good. I'll address the financing first because that's the obvious thing. Yes, we've got a challenging balance sheet, okay? And so with the debt load that we have, we would like to use equity where we can. We would like to emerge from any kind of a transaction with -- making further progress. We're strengthen our balance sheet, and we think that we can do that. We believe now that prices have come back up to a more reasonable level, there are more sellers out there, if you want to call them that. There are more sellers willing to sell at these prices, whereas at the -- if you look back at -- in November, December of last year when prices were still pretty low, really, nobody wanted to sell their assets at $40 oil."
957,en,1,866,1,0.552045,positive,,positive,0.675131,"Now getting back to the portion of your question associated with what type of assets, well, we really like the area that we're in. We really like the economics of the projects that we have in our own inventory. And so yes, ideally, we would like to spread our very effective operating team over more wells and more barrels of production in the areas that we operate. So the synergies is an obvious thing. And so -- however, I'm not going to tell you that we would only buy assets in and around where we currently operate. But I will say that if we do venture outside of the Central Basin platform, the Southern Shelf, it'll be because the attributes of the acquisition bring with them similar attributes of shallow declines, high margins, undeveloped opportunity, have low breakeven costs and short payouts and that type of thing. And probably primarily oil as well."

So I was wondering if we could dig in a little more kind of on the '21 program and how you kind of see that playing out. What's the 10 to 12 completions and the timing of those over the course of the year? And I would assume that the 4 wells drilled in January -- or December and January, that's baked into this 10 to 12. Is that right?"

We were originally thinking that we were going to pick up a drilling rig to start our next campaign sometime in the summer.

So a lot of the first production history, I mean, the original operator there drilled wells in 2016, and other operators within the area had started drilling in '15, so there's quite a bit of production history for those wells. And as far as the 1.5-miles well, it's beneficial to get an extra 0.5 mile because you already have the location set up and you get that extra completion from that.

So that seems to be moving ahead smoothly. With respect to potential sales volumes, there remains a deficit still in the electrical market related to the delay of Ituango hydroelectric project.

I can't -- at this point in time, I can't give you any clear goals or targets. Obviously, we're cognizant of share price fluctuations, when it may be more opportune as to less. I will say that some of you probably on the line probably received questionnaires that Canacol sent out. We're actively soliciting shareholders thoughts with respect to what they viewed as more valuable, increased dividends or increased share buybacks or increased debt repayments.

1135,en,1,849,1,-0.442329,negative,1,negative,-0.257119,"Yes, that's a very good question. This relates directly to a deferred tax write-down we did in Q4. So in late 2020, a Council of State Court ruling essentially disallowed the use of losses on merge companies. So the particular case that was in front of the court at that point in time was not an oil and gas case. And it had different facts, circumstances than the Canacol case. It's probably important to note that the DN [ph] has yet to change the tax laws to reflect that particular court's ruling. So as you can imagine that has affected many companies, and many challenges to that ruling are expected in the near future, with Canacol being one of those challenges. So many experts believe the ruling is unconstitutional. And it was due to the ambiguity surrounding that ruling that we do recognize the deferred tax assets on our balance sheets."

I should note that it was that particular court only disallowed certain tax losses in that particular case. So, we're hopeful that we will get that back and obviously we're working with local experts via constitution or tax wise on that particular topic. But we ended with 60 -- at the end of the year with $68 million in cash. We've got a $46 million revolving line of credit that is untouched, and our budgets would not be looking to touch that.

We've been shifting more and more exploration activity into VIM-5, which is where Clarinete and Pandereta are located.

This leaves us only €400 million negative delta working capital at the end of 2020, which will be reabsorbed in early 2021.

So our expectations is that energy demand in 2021 will go back to 2019 levels. Right now, for the numbers we have on February, we can say that we see a demand that is in line what with February last year. So the level of demand that was before the starting of the lockdown for COVID. So this is encouraging because we think that this trend is -- there are no other fell out of COVID without further lockdown is progressively recovering."

1426,en,1,254,1,0.649919,positive,,positive,0.627849,"Okay. I think we move to retail now. Francesco, for you. It's a kind of a recurring, recurring question. The end of the regulated tariff in Italy has been postponed further. What's the impact -- what is the impact you see from this on your business plan?"
1427,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Francesco Starace
1428,en,1,353,1,0.382206,positive,1,positive,0.45413,"This is, as you know, very well, those that follow this saga since now 4 years, 3.5 years, you know very well that I have always maintained that every new government has this wildcard to postpone the tariff. And this, again, has happened. I think -- by the way, it happened with the old government before they left. So I mean, it's even more the cooler."
1429,en,1,380,1,0.381111,positive,1,negative,-0.452071,"So I think this is not a surprise for anyone. I think it is not a big game changer. For us, we've always factored in, in the next three years, somehow this thing, but we have always kept our strategy of gradually and inexorably, I would say, grow our customer base, getting customers out of the related tariffs while this regulated tariff was in place, and this is now continuing."
1430,en,1,402,1,0.554935,positive,1,positive,0.571375,"So I think it is mildly positive going -- looking at the track record that we have in this field, it is very stable. Looking at how the market looks, it is changing nothing in terms of competitive pressure. It is prolonging the actual situation, which for us, I would say, is a well-known territory in which we will continue to implement the strategy of growth that we have so far successfully pursued."
1431,en,1,129,1,0.979831,positive,,positive,0.980385,"So I see a very, very small impact in terms of economic returns, but a very stable continuity in the growth of our customer base."

1435,en,1,152,1,-0.670048,negative,,neutral,0.0,"Okay. So in Italy, power sold in 2020 had been down overall by 3%. B2B segment was down 6%. That it means roughly 3 terawatt hours. In B2C was up by 7%."
1436,en,1,340,1,0.357989,positive,1,positive,0.344506,"That roughly is 1 terawatt hour more. In Iberia, volumes are down overall 11%. B2B contraction was up 13%. We are talking about roughly 8 terawatt hours, with B2C down 4%. Also here is less than 1 terawatt hour. Overall, the contraction of industrial activities is the main driver for the contraction. And now we see a progressive recovery."
1437,en,1,473,1,0.708247,positive,,positive,0.662839,"Worth mentioning that the reduction in the B2B segment is the -- as the less marginality in the overall portfolio of our selling, that's why -- so the increase in B2C, with a higher level of marginality, covered almost entirely the reduction in marginality coming from B2B. And the only impact, really impact that we had on retail in 2020 was the long position, the temporary long position that was created by the sharp contraction in the B2B demand following the lockdown."

1439,en,1,329,1,0.647492,positive,,positive,0.61313,"Okay. So you spent a few words on the margins, which I think is also answering another question associated with B2B and B2C for Italy and Spain. So we move to a question which asked the latest observation around demand in Italy and Spain. So have you seen recently any recovery? What are the residual risks associated with COVID?"
1440,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
1441,en,1,353,1,0.652919,positive,1,positive,0.543135,"Yes. So in the first two months, we know a big bump, but we are observing a little trend of recovery that started in the second half of last year with some stop and go along the second part of 2020. Today, we see the electricity demand is flat in Italy and with minus 1% in Spain. So this is a steady recovery of demand that we observed along the month."

1443,en,1,334,1,0.546321,positive,,positive,0.529105,Okay. I think we are approaching the two last questions and are both for the CFO. One is on the hybrid. So we move to the financials. So you have €2.1 billion hybrid bonds still accounted as debt. Are you going to change the maturity to perpetual and accounting as equity from now onwards? Will all the hybrids be accounted as equity?
1444,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
1445,en,1,555,1,0.817745,positive,,positive,0.807336,"Well, so we have started the process last year, as you know, and so we are looking to continue to do so also in the next year. We will use, depending on the overall impact, consent solicitation like we did for the first time in the last year or so we will wait the refinancing time for other. So it will depend on the market condition. And so we will evaluate accordingly with the best approach. At the beginning of this month, I remember that we have just issued the new hybrids for €2.25 billion, and these new hybrids will be fully accounted as equity."
1446,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Monica Girardi
1447,en,1,145,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Okay. Last one, the expectation of a less favorable interest rate environment can change or accelerate the deployment of your financial strategy?"

1449,en,1,321,1,0.422711,positive,1,positive,0.376516,"Well, we constantly monitor the evolution of economic and financial environment. To give you an example, we took for the hybrid bonds, a clear wind between 2x of some tool bullets in the market. The window was very clear. And so we get a very, very low level of cost. So the hybrid we issued had the overall cost of 1.7%."
1450,en,1,334,1,0.887638,positive,,positive,0.883349,"I think the lowest level of cost for a hybrid bond. And so we will do it also looking forward. I think that a lot of windows will be ready to refinance the debt. And so I would say, so we will -- I think we will have another one year or one. Five years of level-playing fields to finance or refinance the debt, but we worked that way."
1451,en,1,224,1,0.718711,positive,,positive,0.886432,"So the final answer is, I think, that we don't have any kind of impact for the foreseeable future, but also tactically speaking, we are working on windows being ready to do something soon as the condition are so easy for us."

Each quarter we include a brief overview of the company shown on slide 3 for new investors. Taking a look at the full year fiscal 2020, which ended on October 31st, our total revenue grew by double digit to approximately $71 million. Our three largest categories service and licenses, advanced technologies and generation represent diversified sources of recurring revenue under multiyear contracts with investment grade customers. Consistent with our strategy, in future quarters, we expect the work we have done to rebuild our business development and go-to-market capabilities, recruit and onboard strategic talent and reenter and build client relationships and target global markets to yield growth including product sales."
1492,en,1,982,1,0.883355,positive,,positive,0.889981,"Consistent with our prior experience in certain markets, such as Korea, the largest fuel cell market in the world, select countries across Europe and other international markets, we expect some customers to choose to purchase our platform bundled with long-term service contracts that run coterminous with platforms like should our marketing efforts be successful. We are optimistic about the momentum behind the global energy transition that we expect to be enabled by distributed generation, distributed hydrogen, long duration hydrogen energy storage and carbon capture. At the top of the slide, we highlight many of our customers currently utilizing our multi featured fuel cell platforms. Many of these systems integrate combined heat and power capabilities, creating very high energy efficiency levels, while others installations form the backbone of micro grids enhancing resiliency and reliability and/or utilize biofuel resulting in carbon neutral to carbon negative power."
1493,en,1,711,1,0.761443,positive,,positive,0.825966,"Our platforms also have the ability to leverage multiple fuel types, a feature many customers are interested in. In addition, our carbonate fuel cell platform has the ability to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen platform. And we're developing a new capability of running our carbon and fuel cell in reverse or an electrolysis mode through a process known as Reforming, Electrolysis and Purification or REP. We believe that the distributed nature of our hydrogen platform can enable the hydrogen economy in advance of the midstream infrastructure availability. FuelCell Energy offers diversification across fuel cell technologies that enable solutions across multiple applications or jobs that need to be done."
1494,en,1,1049,1,0.729526,positive,1,positive,0.722204,"Additionally, as I will cover later in my remarks, we continue to advance the commercialization of our solid oxide fuel cell platform to produce hydrogen through highly efficient electrolysis, long duration hydrogen based energy storage, and zero carbon hydrogen power generation. We believe that these technologies can provide the firm capacity required to support intermittent renewable technologies, such as wind and solar, by converting the off peak energy occasionally generated by renewables, or excess energy produced in excess of demand into hydrogen that is stored and later set back to the same FuelCell Energy fuel cell stack to produce zero carbon power. Recently, the world watch the disruption and loss of life in Texas that caused by unavailability of power. FuelCell Energy is committed to delivering base load power installation across our carbonate and solid oxide platforms that can and have demonstrated their ability to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future. We stand ready to support customers around the world."
1495,en,1,727,1,0.732996,positive,1,positive,0.771816,"Next, moving to slide 4, I want to highlight our commitment to our purpose of enabling the world to live a life empowered by clean energy. We believe that all people around the world will increasingly need reliable always on power. The electric grid continues to evolve, but grid reliability remains a critical issue. We believe that FuelCell Energy is uniquely positioned to meet the reliability challenges with our broad product portfolio that can also assist with decarbonization goals. We don't subscribe to the notion that decarbonization has to mean de-industrialization, or the developing countries around the world can't participate in industrialized society. This purpose drives our strategic focus and the work we do."
1496,en,1,727,1,0.606852,positive,,positive,0.65521,"Turning now to the quarter, I have three overarching messages. The first is that we are continuing to make progress against our $1.27 billion backlog. As we execute our powerhouse business strategy by working differently and thus adds another 40.7 megawatts to our generation portfolio. Subsequent to quarter end with the addition of our new 2.8 megawatt PPA for our second project in Derby, Connecticut, our backlog has increased to 43.5 megawatts. We have completed the majority of our scope of work on the 7.4 megawatt project at the US Navy base in Groton, Connecticut. The company is currently awaiting the interconnection and other safety related work to be completed prior to the commissioning and commercial operations."
1497,en,1,1128,1,0.699844,positive,,positive,0.754992,"The interconnection agreement for this project is a four party agreement and has taken longer than originally estimated to complete. FuelCell Energy looks forward to fortifying the power infrastructure supporting base resiliency, and the US Federal Government's defense critical electrical infrastructure objectives. Additionally, construction activity has been substantially complete for a 1.4 megawatt project at the San Bernardino, California Wastewater Treatment facility that will utilize onside biofuel to produce carbon neutral power. We're working with the local utility on the interconnection process prior to commissioning and commencing commercial operation. I want to provide a more color on interconnection for those less familiar with the process. Essentially, prior to being able to operate in parallel with the utility grid network, a series of studies such as a feasibility, distant impact and distribution studies are required to be performed by the appropriate local utility for distribution level interconnects or in some cases by the regional transmission organization for larger or grid connected projects."
1498,en,1,899,1,0.855381,positive,,positive,0.850562,"Before distributed electrical generation equipment is approved for connection to or operation in parallel with the grid, which is a requirement for commercial operation. These studies assess the addition of the power generation platform and its impact on the existing utility power system, as well as identify any interconnection facilities or network upgrades needed for interconnecting the platform to the utility grid. The lead time for this process can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the utilities ability to prioritize the studies, the technical complexity of the project site, and infrastructure work required by the utility prior to interconnection. We proactively manage every aspect of the interconnection process within our scope and responsibility to obtain interconnection as quickly as possible, while ensuring compliance with all safety and reliability requirements."
1499,en,1,853,1,0.917019,positive,,positive,0.811265,"As noted in the case of Groton, this work is being managed by a third party. We have also commenced construction on 24.5 megawatts of projects, including the 2.3 megawatt Trigen hydrogen platform that will deliver carbon neutral electricity, green hydrogen and produce water to Toyota at the Port of Long Beach. We believe our Trigen hydrogen platform is the only platform in the world that produces hydrogen and usable water in a single distributed platform. In addition, we are advancing our utility scale deployments in Yaphank, Long Island, New York and Derby, Connecticut. We were able to resume manufacturing with necessary safety enhancements at our Torrington Connecticut manufacturing facility in June of 2020. And we have established a phased and return to work schedule for those employees that have been working from home through this month."

The second key message I want to highlight is the progress we've made toward bolstering our financial foundation, strengthening our liquidity and creating an opportunity to reduce our cost of capital. As we have previously disclosed during the quarter, we completed an additional equity offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately $156 million. And third, I want to reiterate our goal of strengthening our leadership and sustainability and environmental stewardship. Customers around the world are increasingly looking for authentic, onsite and sustainable decarbonize energy solutions to address climate challenges, enhance grid reliability, and enable them to continue to operate their businesses without intermittent disruptions. To meet the growing global need for clean decarbonized energy, FuelCell Energy remains focused on developing and deploying our product portfolio solutions for some of the largest global energy opportunities."

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021; we delivered $14.9 million in total revenue, a 9% decline compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The primary driver of the decrease was that the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 included $4 million of nonrecurring license revenues associated with our Joint Development Agreement or JDA with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company or EMRE related to carbon capture technology development."

Whereas revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 included nonrecurring license revenues of $4 million associated with our JDA with EMRE and $1.6 million associated with routine monitoring and maintenance activities for projects under service agreements. Generation revenues decreased 10% to $4.9 million due to a temporary shutdown of several of the individual plants at the Bridgeport fuel cell project for scheduled module exchanges in the quarter. Advanced Technology contract revenues decrease 3% to $5.1 million from $5.2 million. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Advanced Technology contract revenues recognized under the JDA with EMRE were approximately $300,000 higher during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, reflecting continued advancement of our joint research with EMRE on fuel cell carbon capture solutions during the quarter."

As I mentioned earlier, recent headlines in Texas surrounding extreme weather, as well as continued challenges for grid reliability in markets such as California, or the extreme freeze in Greece in the UK in February, continue to expose the inherent challenges of a long distance transmission based grid. In cities across America, governments and utilities alike are hopeful any infrastructure package contemplated by Congress in the new administration will include funding to upgrade today's grid with reliable distributed megawatt scale power platforms. Our platforms not only run 24x7x365 but have demonstrated their performance stability during some of nature's more extreme conditions. Highlighted on the chart to the left are numerous examples where our shore source platforms operated seamlessly and prolonged instances of extreme temperatures providing universities, industry credible resources and the broader utility grid with reliable power?"

Distributed generation, distributed hydrogen and long duration storage, and carbon capture. We believe that each of these has a very large total addressable market opportunity for which we are working to position the company to benefit. We continue to advance research and development of our carbonate fuel cell platforms efficiency, capturing carbon from an external source, while also producing power. Our proprietary carbon capture solution is the only solution that we know of that captures carbon from an external source and produces power rather than consuming it, and is also capable of producing hydrogen for distributed applications. We also can directly capture carbon from our own shore source power platform for carbon utilization and/or sequestration."

Our carbonate platform, featured on the right side of this line allows us to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen hydrogen platform. The first half of the word Trigen is important because the platform delivers three value streams to our customers. First, it delivers power. Second, it produces hydrogen, and third, it actually produces water while delivering hydrogen. Adding more value in areas where water for electrolysis is at a premium, which as previously stated, we believe makes it the only platform in the world that produces water and hydrogen."

We're in the process of building the first commercial installation of this platform for Toyota at the Port of Long Beach today. When the coproduction of power is not required, our carbonate platform is being developed to produce green, blue or grey hydrogen through a reformer electrolyzer purifier process, RREP. Our solid oxide technology pictured here on the left side of this slide, which we are advancing to commercialization is designed to produce green, blue and grey hydrogen through highly efficient, high temperature electrolysis. In addition to our solid oxide fuel cell being designed to be highly efficient, operating at a high temperature, and having the ability to leverage waste to achieve even higher efficiency, it is designed to operate in reverse mode."
1527,en,1,650,1,0.600521,positive,,positive,0.594598,"The same platform stack used to convert electricity and water into hydrogen is reversible solid oxide mode will produce zero carbon power using the stored hydrogen. So one might ask why three platforms? The answer is simple. Customers want to accomplish different objectives and need to get different jobs done. Each location will have a unique pricing environment for fuel and electricity. In markets with higher power prices, our Trigen platform might be the best solution if you can sell the electricity into the grid at higher prices, which reduces the cost of the produced hydrogen, or perhaps local water is in scarce supply or is at a premium."
1528,en,1,833,1,0.811098,positive,,positive,0.830134,"We expect our developing REP platform to work well across various fuel and electric price environments and in environments where selling power to the grid is not an option. And it should be uniquely situated to carbon capture applications to produce blue hydrogen. With our solid oxide platforms high efficiency, design and expectation to leverage waste, it is expected to be well suited for low energy price environments and environments with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources. The breadth and depth of our developing technology portfolio positioned FuelCell Energy to deliver distributed hydrogen across several environments around the world. The flexibility we expect to provide around distributed platform, source and price of hydrogen will enable us to add value in almost all energy segments globally."

The deal we project will incorporate a multi stack electrolysis system utilizing our solid oxide technology. The system will also be equipped with an option to receive thermal energy, thus expected to increase the electrolysis electrical efficiency from about 90% to approximately 100%. Following the design, manufacture and testing of the system at FuelCell Energy facilities, the electrolysis system will be delivered to Idaho National Laboratories, where it will undergo rigorous testing to confirm the electrical efficiency as well as the ability to utilize nuclear power plant waste to obtain higher efficiencies of up to 100%."

If you're using natural gas and add carbon capture, you will probably -- you'll obviously you'll have to power that carbon capture equipment to some extent. So our 2.8 megawatt system in Trigen mode is 2.3 megawatts, you would probably go down to something like 2.1 with carbon capture."

As Jason has mentioned, all of the sites civil construction has been completed, all of the required equipment and materials have been fabricated and delivered to the site. All the mechanical assembly construction is complete at this point with the majority of the electrical installation completed as well. Right now we're in the process of discrete equipment checkout and safety related work as part of the commissioning process. And once we complete that plant commissioning process, we'll be well positioned to export power once interconnect is executed and finalized.

Today, we have operating about 30 megawatts of operating assets and as we said in our remarks, we're in the process of building out another 40 plus megawatts of assets. So if you think about that operating portfolio, last year, we generated about $20 million of annualized revenue. Well, we're more than doubling the operating portfolio here over the next period of time as these projects, come online, so they'll begin to make meaningful contributions to increasing our generation revenue as they come online."

And Exxon in their Investor Day a couple of weeks ago talked a good bit about how central carbon capture was to their various green initiatives. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about in the event there, there are new technologies that you aren't directly involved in introducing to the JV and for instance, on their call, they mentioned some progress with material technology as far as carbon capture from a gas stream. And I just wonder are those sorts of things do you have some access to those or is there some provision in your agreement where you would be able to get access to other things that they in the course of the JV?"

So as a company, we are an as the joint development agreement to that we have in place with Exxon is very focused on our carbonate fuel cell technology. And what's compelling about the carbonate fuel cell technology are some of the things I mentioned in my comments that it's the only platform that we're aware of, that has the ability to capture carbon from an external source, produce more power at the same time, and deliver hydrogen from that same platform. That is the focus of our work with Exxon, and we believe that those differentiating attributes creates a very compelling proposition for Exxon and for carbon capture overall. And Exxon has a research organization inside their company, and they look at various technologies, but we're very focused on optimizing our carbonate technology to deliver against that."

And that the goal of reducing carbon or overall climate sustainability goals, should not be deindustrialization. And if deindustrialization is not one of the goals, which I don't think it is, then that means carbon capture has to be an important part of the solution. In addition to doing things like fuel substitution, like Hydrogen for example. And so we think we're well positioned to participate in all of those. And then Tony, I don't know if you have any additional comment relative to other technologies that Exxon is working on but that would not relate to us."

So any module exchange that we now do in the fleet has a seven year life and obviously extending stack life is a key tenet of our R&D activities. Specific to the generation portfolio and what I mentioned on Bridgeport, Bridgeport is a 15 megawatt projects multiple plants at Bridgeport. So over the last couple of quarters, we have been doing module exchanges there with the goal of obviously extending life, as I just mentioned, but also increasing output.

I have a couple of COVID impact questions and then two follow-up. First on the Jelmyto sales effort being conductive in the context of COVID-19, do you anticipate being able to conduct same promotional activities in the coming months that you weren’t able to perform previously? And because the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing [ph] down and then in terms of the ATLAS trial enrollment, you mentioned, you expect to provide enrollment update there, I mean -- but I mean, do you see any logistical challenge in execution of the trial due to COVID-19 and if so, what are they using, how are you mitigating that? Thanks."

1893,en,1,344,1,0.807943,positive,,positive,0.840739,"But we felt like we have enough sites and is one of the reasons that we actually increase the number of sites versus our initial expectation, because we wanted to make sure that with COVID, if a country or area shutdown, that we would be able to sort of makeup that enrollment elsewhere. So, and then, Jeff, do you want to comment on promotion?"

1895,en,1,457,1,0.749038,positive,,positive,0.689092,"Sure. So what we’ve seen is an increase in face-to-face interactions. I was fortunate to get out with some accounts last week, a couple weeks ago and the face-to-face is improving. So they’re opening up to face-to-face interactions. And more importantly, they open up to have representatives come in and do presentations over lunch. So a lot of places that have limited lunches or face-to-face interaction are slowly beginning to open those interactions up."
1896,en,1,363,1,0.945253,positive,,positive,0.95144,"Where that’s still limited, we continue. The field does an excellent job of continuing to have virtual reminders, virtual presentations with the physicians, being mindful and respectful of what the office prefers at this time.

And if not, why do you think that, why not?"

I mean, I think, someone asked a question to, the -- we want all of our sites activated, treating more than one patient. I mean, we want to get to the point where physicians are opening it up. We’ve had that too. You have initially you obviously have a champion in the office. But they ask and the goal of the reps -- representatives are to go in and open it up to the other physician. So you have it."
1901,en,1,615,1,0.829841,positive,,positive,0.829841,"So I expect both numbers to continue to grow as we’ve got a large number of accounts that either putting it on formulary, have it on formulary, looking for a patient and then once they experience using Jelmyto with the patient, either finding more patients or certainly that that peer-to-peer influence that I talked about, discussing it with other physicians during their, all of these accounts have tumor boards or medical meetings with their urologist. Making sure that we’re part of that agenda is a key goal for us to get the majority of the urologists within an account considering Jelmyto for their patients."

So, are there any timeframe restrictions on the funding received from RTW investments? So, in other words, does RTW have right to impose additional conditions or require additional consideration of the $300 million amounts not paid back within a specific period of time? And will are these additional commissions if any, so if funding from RTW secured by any of UroGen’s IP tax?"

So that there’s no -- to answer that question, there’s no time commitment. As far as collateral, certainly, they have a security main interest on the strip of Jelmyto. And then that’s carved out within the IP interest as well, but certainly nothing that we believe would prohibit us to look at ex-U.S. or other BB tech activities in these products."

In December, we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company's history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years.

Number two, the average cost per stop decreased by 12% year-over-year.

It has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. At FedEx Express, we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. We know, however, that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term, and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market."

We will have; actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration.

So we now have low-value clearance capabilities, or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile."

On the variable comp, I guess, what I would say to you in that is we wouldn't anticipate that to be a headwind looking at FY 2022. I hope that helps."

2208,en,1,404,1,0.782022,positive,,positive,0.854382,"But I can tell you that while this has been the most difficult crisis of our history and our industry as well as Delta, as a company, I could not be more proud of our people. The great work they've done, the resilience they've shown, the focus about taking care of our customers and our operations, our cash, and so protecting our future to be able to talk to where we're going to be going is remarkable."
2209,en,1,380,1,0.794222,positive,,positive,0.953064,"And I think that over the course of the last year, we've got into this point that we can start to have real -- substantial discussions of the path forward and not only the path forward, but how we're going to emerge from this as a stronger airline, as a more resilient airline, and the things that we've learned over the course of the last year has really, really been phenomenal."
2210,en,1,298,1,0.964439,positive,,positive,0.964439,"So, it's because of that focus around all of our stakeholders, focus on our people, the focus on our customers taking good care of them, the focus on ensuring our shareholders are kept apprised and done the best we could for our owners during this period of time, as well as our community partners."
2211,en,1,494,1,0.586175,positive,1,positive,0.665082,"That holistic focus we've taken on the recovery is what gives me optimism, as we start to see demand coming back in meaningful levels. And we start to see a -- what I consider real glimmers of hope. And we've seen some glimmers of hope over the course of the last year, but they've been false hope, I think -- in most regards, but this seems like it's real, it seems substantive. And we've got a long ways to go yet. We're in a much, much better place than we've been in quite a period of time."
2212,en,1,574,1,-0.694215,negative,,negative,-0.634417,"As we updated our earnings today with a -- with guidance materials, the March quarter has started slower than we were anticipating, but really accelerated the pace of recovery over the course of the quarter and while the numbers are going to be another large loss, we expect because January and February travel demand was really low, really suppressed by the spread of the virus, the infections at peak levels, the warnings from all authorities not just here in the US, but around the world to stay-at-home orders and all the work that was needed to do to contain the virus."
2213,en,1,339,1,0.616615,positive,1,positive,0.596423,"The real story for the quarter, kicked in about, five or six weeks ago when we started to see bookings pickup. And that coincided, clearly, with confidence in the marketplace. People are starting to book their spring and summer plans, and Glen’s going to be giving you an update on the commercial front, in terms of what that means for us."
2214,en,1,199,1,0.858495,positive,,positive,0.858495,"When we look within our quarter, it looks to us that, for the month of March we expect our top line revenues to be about 40% higher, than what we saw in the month of February, which is a big step-up."
2215,en,1,275,1,0.886047,positive,,positive,0.885482,"Of course, you always expect a meaningful step-up from February to March. And so, it's good to see some traditional seasonality starting to come out. Historically, that seasonality has been in the low-to-mid 30 range. So, to get to 40% step-up from February to March is nice."
2216,en,1,253,1,0.396345,positive,1,positive,0.422593,"And I think our team’s done a good job on cost, as well as we've gotten ready for the recovery. But fuel’s the other thing that conspired to keep our losses high within the March quarter, as fuels at the levels we haven't seen in quite a period of time."
2217,en,1,276,1,0.31675,positive,1,positive,0.42967,"Cash burn, for us is coming in pretty close to the mid-point of what we forecasted. We forecasted at the start of the quarter a cash burn on a daily basis of between $10 million and $15 million a day; looks like it's going to come in between $12 million and $14 million a day."
2218,en,1,239,1,-0.702706,negative,,negative,-0.702706,"But the thing that we've noticed in cash burn and probably for me, one of the big takeaways for our conference today is, at Delta, we expect in the month of March to be at or pretty darn close to breakeven for the month of March cash burn."
2219,en,1,172,1,0.343322,positive,,positive,0.343322,"So cash burn for the month of March, because of the booking improvements that we've seen over the course of the last few weeks, it is going to come in pretty close to zero."
2220,en,1,228,1,0.836105,positive,,positive,0.836105,"And that gives us good exit velocity, as we leave the quarter and as we look to the spring, we've mentioned in the past, that our goal is to get to a breakeven cash performance for the spring, which to us was the second quarter."
2221,en,1,279,1,0.928501,positive,,positive,0.932784,"And I continue to be cautiously optimistic that we will see the traction where we're seeing here, we're going to hold it.

2222,en,1,346,1,0.754234,positive,,positive,0.776531,"Now, of course, those forecasts are expectation that the vaccines will continue to rollout, that herd immunity will probably be achieved in our country, probably, hopefully, at some point in the latter part of the second quarter, the late spring or early summer. And that gives confidence back to domestic travel, coming back out in a robust way."

As the US case counts came down from their late January peak, and vaccinations continued to run out in the marketplace. So we've seen what we would consider to be a lot of pent-up demand for primarily domestic and short-haul international leisure travel."
2230,en,1,461,1,0.600053,positive,1,positive,0.626502,"This past week, digital shopping for – as a forward looking marker, were 70% restored to our 2019 levels and that's up nearly 15 points from December. And of course, our look-to-book ratios are continuing to strengthen. So we've seen across all AP windows some very good strength. And that's really to talk a little bit about that, that's very different from anywhere else that we've been in the pandemic with – the further out bookings now starting to come in."
2231,en,1,453,1,0.445447,positive,1,positive,0.444192,"The one thing that was consistent throughout the entire pandemic was the compression of the booking window were inside of 14 and inside of six days, where most of your bookings resided. And really in the past six weeks, we've seen that move out, so that bookings that are beyond 60 days are almost flat to 2019 levels, just down a few points. And that's a very different situation from where we've been in the last year, so very encouraging signs there."
2232,en,1,285,1,-0.349701,negative,,positive,0.579774,"Corporate, as Ed mentioned is still slowly, but steadily building back. We’re in high-teens to low 20s in terms of corporate. And those are major corporations, SMEs are slightly ahead of that and they've been accelerating at a slightly higher pace than the true large corporate travel."
2233,en,1,365,1,0.445764,positive,1,positive,0.500094,"But we do expect that from all the surveys that we've seen out in the marketplace that that will continue to accelerate with many people returning to the office late in 2Q or early in 3Q. So setting up well as we go through the historic leisure period of the summer to have significant increase in bookings for business, as we turn into the fall as looking forward."
2234,en,1,464,1,0.614359,positive,,positive,0.834537,"We have, of course not yet released our middle seat. Our middle seat block is still in place. And that is going to be an incredibly powerful tool. If you think that we were able to get to cash breakeven in the month of March with over 30% of our inventory that's out flying not being sold, as demand continues to return. And as we release those seats into the future, that's going to be an incredibly strong lever for us with very minimal cost open those seats up."
2235,en,1,447,1,0.778478,positive,,positive,0.772487,"So I think, where we're sitting right now is a very different place than where we were sitting last we spoke, and one that we're very encouraged with and one that we see signs across the board. I would say, the one thing that's still the wild card is the long-haul international and when that will open up and we've been working very hard as you know, we have several corridors open for quarantine pre-travel to Europe, which are doing quite well."
2236,en,1,489,1,0.595401,positive,1,positive,0.565046,"But while we're doing very well in the US right now with case counts continuing to decline and vaccinations continuing to accelerate, that's not the case all over the world yet. So we think that's going to be a spotty return. And hopefully, we can get towards late summer a reopening of the Transatlantic, which would be the next thing we really need to achieve here. So lots of encouraging signs, but lots of room to grow and lots of room to continue to improve as we move through spring."

We expect to end the March quarter with $16.5 billion of liquidity and that includes the $2.9 billion of PSP 2 funds that we received during the March quarter, does not include any of the PSP 3 funds in that estimate, which we expect to receive a similar amount to the $2.9 billion of the PSP 2."

2241,en,1,425,1,0.532228,positive,,positive,0.533165,"That liquidity guide that I gave of 16.5 is lower than what we guided back in January, largely due to the decision that we made to repay the $1.5 billion of slots, gates and routes term loan that we took out in the March quarter, a year ago. This brings our total debt repayments to over $7 billion since October, includes the revolver, the 364-day term loan as well as the slots, gates and routes term loan that I mentioned."

We know the strength of our balance sheet is one of the things that enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our industry without having to dilute our shareholders. It's something that has set us apart within the industry and we're already starting down the path to recover the balance sheet. We look forward to getting those investment grade ratings back here over the next couple of years."

Your good friend, Paul Jacobson in the past spoke about a profitable cohabitation with ultra low cost carriers, but these airlines are undoubtedly emboldened by the downturn. We've got some startups in the wings. They're the tip of the recovery sphere, because they are all leisure, they don't have corporate or international networks to worry about. How does the pandemic change the domestic interplay between operating models? And why shouldn't we assume that discounters emerge with more share and Delta with less?"

2252,en,1,507,1,0.607087,positive,1,positive,0.503198,"Well, you know, I think that, we're not playing a share game. We're playing a profit game. And we're very, very secure in our offerings. And I think when you think about what our objective has been through the pandemic, it has continued to offer best-in-class, no matter what your travel needs are. And I'd say one of the things that we all will work on as we continue to release the seats, or as we look to release the seats towards the summer is that, we will have more seats in the lower fare categories."
2253,en,1,520,1,0.427939,positive,1,positive,0.459696,"And I think when you look at, what some of our objectives were going through the pandemic was to make sure we came out stronger and that in the places that we chose to compete that, we did not see share. And I think when you look at how we've done even with this seat block in all of our core hubs; we have maintained the share levels at pre-pandemic levels. And we think that will serve as well as we continue to move towards the back end of this and – and are able to put the full level of inventory back in play here."
2254,en,1,527,1,0.641413,positive,1,positive,0.62301,"So I do see that, a lot of them think that they had a great opportunity there. But the other thing that we've been working on through the pandemic is improving our fleet mix. And you know, that peaceful cohabitation that Paul described was when we are able to put our large stage equipment up against them, some of our highest margins are directly against your LCC –in LCC market. So that's another piece that we've accelerated in the pandemic. So I think we're going to come through as I mentioned earlier, stronger than ever."

Well, let's bring Ed into that conversation because the initial market view several months ago was that, Delta and the industry would not return to prior margin levels, given due to corporate demand, higher debt levels and so forth. Obviously, the markets view is far more optimistic today. But what level of confidence do you have that Delta cannot only return to but exceed your prior margins and what are the primary drivers there?"

I think we've got a real – a real good path to do that. When you think about three of the core ingredients to that first of all, the strength of our customer interactions, the strength of our brand, arguably has never been stronger. As we've gone through the pandemic, we've seen a full 20 point increase in Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores are in the 70 range."
2259,en,1,506,1,-0.703696,negative,,negative,-0.732021,"And that was one of the reasons and – and that's despite the fact that we were blocking those seats or maybe because in some cases, but you saw the premium that we were also receiving on the revenue front through that crisis. I think we – over the course of the last -- the last couple of quarters, we've generated more passenger revenue compared to our main competitors, despite the fact that we had significantly fewer seats available for sale, that really strengthens the proposition of the Delta brand."
2260,en,1,339,1,0.774924,positive,1,positive,0.75201,"I can't tell you, every single day, I get notes from customers thanking us for how we treat them. And by the way, it's not just the middle seat block, that's been a part of it. But it's really been the great work our team has done throughout that. So I think we're entering through this with a stronger brand and more differentiated brand."
2261,en,1,681,1,0.415157,positive,1,positive,0.423994,"We're going to come through this with a streamlined cost structure. We've retired 200 of our oldest planes, we've got another 200 planes that we're going to be accelerating the retirement of that those efficiencies that we're going to – we're going to garner from that, we've looked at – our staffing were down about 20% in overall headcount because of the early retirement arrangements. And we've had to be pretty creative than how we've managed our cost. Our costs have been down close to 50% throughout the pandemic, and there's a lot that we've gained from that. The one thing that I – it’s going to take a little bit of time to repair is that – is that balance sheet strength."

One of the things that, I've been really impressed with the brand, not only in terms of customers, behavior and commitment to the brand, and again, a lot of the customers that were traveling were not our primary, most are loyal customers. So that to me was the most important thing."
2270,en,1,259,1,0.0,neutral,,negative,-0.300253,"So this was not a strongly loyal Delta base travelers. It’s a business travelers or premium travelers. This was largely a price seekers that were – that’d have been out in the market for the last year, and yet our brand still stood strong through that period."

Our co-brands spend is held in total, up really well as with Steve Squeri, a few days ago. And I think on a year-over-year basis we're down less than 10% on a year-over-year basis in terms of what Amex is seeing in terms of total co-brand spend on the Delta Card, largely because of T&E being down in such a material way."

How should we think about future Latin American profitability, post bankruptcy for LatAm and Aeroméxico? What does that mean for the JV and Delta's results in that region?"

As Ed said earlier, our international partners have not received the support from their respective governments the U.S. carriers have received from there. And that has led to a rash of bankruptcies and consolidations across the map."

And so, what you seen is, the weakest of the week have either restructured or gone away depending on the entity and will not be coming back with the amount of capacity or with the ferocious appetite for growth that they had in the past."
2281,en,1,530,1,0.927018,positive,,positive,0.918341,"So I think whether you're looking at Latin or whether you're looking at Trans-Atlantic, or even in the Trans-Pacific, we're emerging from this in a very different position than we were going in. And as Ed said, when you combine that with our fleet improvements internationally with the fleet renewal that we've been working on through the pandemic, I think you can easily see where we can make significant improvements in every region with our partners and with our new fleet as we emerge from this. So, very exciting time for us."

And by the end of the year, you were back talking about the great partnership that you have with Airbus on the fleet renewal and so forth."

How you're thinking about that, and how you're thinking about ESG, which I think is post pandemic, obviously, one of the biggest issues that we're all facing as stakeholders here in the airline industry?"

And you're right, in the throes of the virus, I was looking at some numbers the other day that on April 4 -- now that our TSA count as an industry are back over 1 million a day and rising, April 14 or so was about the low point, which I think is when we had that earnings call in the first quarter. I think the TSA count for the industry was 87,000 people, it's just stunning. So, yes, in the throes of that, we suspended not just deliveries and payments of aircraft, but just about everything that we could find."
2287,en,1,290,1,0.796513,positive,,positive,0.796278,"But as we've worked through the course of the year, we did a very good job of being able to retain our positions with Airbus, we slid the book to the right by a couple of years, as I think you're aware, and maintain the commitments, but that's what partners do. And we've worked creatively."

We took over the -- in the latter part of the year, last year the 220-300, launched a new fleet for us; it's doing well in the mix. And as we look forward, a big, big part of our recovery is they continue to upgauge with more domestic network, which is going to be predicated on the Airbus 321s that we will continue to take as we eliminated many, many of our -- large number, the 200 aircraft I talked about that retired over the last year, were small domestic narrowbody, smaller gauged aircraft."

How does that fit in with fleet right now and have you -- I mean, pre-pandemic, we've had some conversations about the old Delta, the Old Northwest, certainly, right would run planes into the ground, running forever, and so forth. And there seem definitely to be a shift towards renewing the fleet even before we were in the pandemic. Obviously, I'm just sort of wondering, right now, on the carbon side, how the fleet renewal fits in with that?"

One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that we were able to retire many of those old airplanes that you that you referred to. In 2020, on a per seat basis, our total fuel burn was down 6% on a year-over-year basis over 2019. So, that's a big number. And that's a number that we see entering 2021, because a lot of that burn was we received over the course of the latter parts of 2020."

We tripled that in 2020 and that's not due to lower volume, that's just due to the actual seats that we were flying. And I see in 2021 us continuing to make good progress. I can see when we get towards the end of 2021 versus 2019, that number could be as high as 10% that we are -- we've improved our fuel efficiency over this period of time."
2295,en,1,203,1,0.712883,positive,,positive,0.712883,"So, those opportunities are real, every plane that we take on the domestic narrowbody side, whether it's the 220s, the 321s are coming in about 25% more fuel efficient than the plane that we're retiring."

First, I want to thank our 2,000-plus colleagues around the world for delivering strong results for both the quarter and the year. This past year's challenges have forced us all to navigate our daily lives with both grace and grit, and I want to express my sincere appreciation to our Harte Hanks employees who are approached each day with just that. I hope that everyone on this call has similarly managed through the year and could take comfort that we're hopefully nearing the life at the end of the tunnel. We're pleased to announce that we have structured our business into three operating segments: Marketing Services, Customer Care and Fulfillment  Logistics. As will be provided in our 10-K, we've begun segment reporting to reflect this."

I'll highlight our strengthened financial position, the excellent results from our Customer Care business, the progress on our cost reduction efforts, our new executive hires and our optimism around our business going forward. To begin with, first, our strengthened financial position. In 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet and began 2021 with $29.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and we anticipate an additional $7.5 million from an income tax refund by year end."
2345,en,1,509,1,0.873649,positive,,positive,0.86718,"Secondly, our contact center results for the year. Revenue grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5% for the quarter, fueled by continuing project work, increased volume from existing clients and new wins. In 2020, we made significant progress transforming our Customer Care business from a prototypical call center BPO to a tech-first offering, aggregating cross-channel interactions to provide our clients with 360-degree customer profile and leveraging our Harte Hanks CRM marketing services capabilities."

We integrate this solution across the multiple CRMs we support, including Oracle CX, Salesforce and Zendesk. Huge kudos to Ben Chacko, our new Managing Director for Customer Care and for his stellar team for leading an amazing transformation of the business in 2020."
2348,en,1,450,1,0.807103,positive,,positive,0.71184,"Thirdly, our cost reductions. We implemented cost reductions across every aspect of the company, reducing overall costs in 2020 by over $20 million. Our cost cutting was a key contributor to our $1.9 million in positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, our third quarter in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. We reduced our operating expenses in all areas, including labor, production, distribution, advertising and selling, general and G&A expenses."

We transformed our fulfillment business from a high-touch subscale B2B program focus to full-service B2B and B2C e-commerce fulfillment, powered by a cloud-based WMS and OMS. In Marketing Services, we now sell integrated CRM focused on the entire customer journey and powered by decades of first-party data experience."
2352,en,1,811,1,0.89704,positive,,positive,0.906497,"And lastly, our optimism for growth in 2021. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we believe our businesses are extremely well positioned for a post-COVID world. Our three operating segments participate in large addressable markets that benefit from the e-commerce increase due to behavioral shifts from the pandemic. We're confident that this shift is a lasting trend to continue well beyond the pandemic. We have a unified go-to-market positioning as an omnichannel customer experience company and believe we have a highly differentiated products and service offering. Equally important, we have strong client relationships in high-growth categories such as Financial Services, CPG, Healthcare and B2B tech, with room to grow and with a new leadership team focused on adding value to these relationships and beyond."
2353,en,1,315,1,0.807423,positive,,positive,0.86235,"To conclude, as we enter 2021, we feel confident in our turnaround. Our Customer Care business is back on track, delivering strong performance after years of decline. We have new executives leading Marketing Services and Fulfillment  Logistics, and we expect to see improved performance in 2021 in these businesses."

Revenues grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5% for the quarter; this was fueled by continuing project work as well as increased volumes with existing clients. Our Marketing Services business was down a modest 6.3% mostly due to reductions in our clients' 2020 marketing budgets due to COVID. Fulfillment  Logistics was down 39.3% due to the elimination of our mail production facility as well as impacts due to COVID for some clients."

Our cost cutting, coupled with revenue stabilization and growth are key contributors to the positive and consistent adjusted EBITDA. This is the third quarter in a row that we are adjusted EBITDA positive at $1.9 million in Q4. With respect to new business, I am pleased to report that our current weighted pipeline is $14.8 million. Our unweighted pipeline is $41 million, both of which remain strong heading into 2021."

I'd now like to walk through the quarterly results in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues were $47.1 million compared to $52.3 million in the year ago quarter for a year-over-year revenue decline of $5.2 million or 10%. Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $47.4 million, down from $51.9 million in the year ago quarter. We reduced our operating expenses in labor and production and distribution, the decreases were driven from reduction in transportation and facility expenses as well as expenses related to the closure of our mail facilities."

By segment, 2020 revenue in Marketing Services was $67.1 million compared to $66.2 million in 2019. Operating income in this segment was $5 million compared to $4.7 million in 2019. The cost reductions that we made enabled us to achieve the increase in operating income despite the year-over-year decline in revenue. Customer care had a strong performance for the year with revenue at $58.7 million in 2020 versus $48.4 million in 2019. Operating income was $5.8 million, up from a loss of $4.8 million a year ago.

Our operating expenses for the full year 2020 were $187.5 million compared to $239.2 million in 2019, a decrease of $51.7 million or 21.6%. The $51.7 million decline in operating expenses more than offset the $40.7 million decline in revenues adding to our momentum of improved financial results.

I know you operate in a very difficult environment as many media companies, and you did – you executed very well. I appreciate that. So a couple of questions. Since the company is organized now into three operating segments, can you kind of talk a little bit about how each segment is where there – where most of the revenue is derived from, like in terms of categories like, for instance, maybe you could just talk about the accounts or – what accounts for large portions of the revenues in each one of those segments?"

So our Marketing Services business is essentially a CRM business, a CRM agency that has a few components in it, everything from strategy to creative, to technology to implement e-mail solutions. So when you think about that business and as we think about that business, you would look at competitors within the big holding companies in their CRM pure-play agencies. Our Fulfillment  Logistics business does multiple aspects today of fulfillment, literature fulfillment, product fulfillment, and then we also do trade marketing fulfillment would be the three biggest categories."
2374,en,1,692,1,0.541113,positive,1,positive,0.491105,"As you're aware, there's been a decline in literature fulfillment as a category as there's less printing as a whole. So when you look at three components of the business as it stands today, we see growth in product fulfillment, which is obviously what B2B and B2C e-commerce is about. That is e-commerce product fulfillment. And then our Customer Care business, as I mentioned on the call, is transforming, and the majority of the revenue, those are all based on a number of seats with any given client for the services. What I would say is that the transformation that we've made has been to offer more technology services as well. And so we see that business transforming as well over time."

And some of what we thought would be short-term project work that continued into longer than we had planned. But there's still a portion, maybe between 10% and 20%, that what we would consider project work that's not necessarily recurring. But I think that there's still opportunities to continue to grow that and expand in some of that project work that we can continue to do even if its six months to a year-long project rather than a short period."

Certainly, some of our costs normally would fluctuate with the revenue. We're continuing through our restructuring that we expect to complete in 2021. And as you know, we've discussed before, reducing our facilities footprint has certainly been a focus as well as some IT projects we've had going on. We're also embarking on an implementation of a new cloud-based ERP system that we expect to drive additional efficiency in the business and enable us to reduce costs further in the coming years, especially in our overhead-related costs."

Secondly, we've also – and we've discussed this in the past, our goal is to be as asset-light, and that's not just from a real estate footprint standpoint, which we've made tremendous progress over the last few years. But also in terms of technology, as an example. So in our Fulfillment  Logistics business, we're moving towards a much more open architecture, OMS, WMS and reducing our own internal labor for development. So not only are we not reliant going forward on third-party vendors, but we're also not reliant on fixed cost or we won't be as reliant on fixed cost to maintain systems and deliver our work."

2398,en,1,352,1,0.739805,positive,,positive,0.700951,"Yes. So the – as we've talked about, we like to see the weighted pipeline that's weighted at 75% or higher on conversion, likeliness to convert at – tracking at about $15 million. Obviously, the quality of a pipeline is as important as the numbers. Where we feel encouraged is that the quality of what is in there is of higher quality than in the past."

So it's a higher quality, higher ticket item, but it's also leveraging more services. So one way to look at it, obviously, is that number. But the other way, which is obviously tougher to see, is the quality. And as we announce more and more client wins and you see the types of client wins, that's another way to see the transition and the work that we're doing, which is towards higher margin, higher ticket item work across all of our businesses."

And we executed on our commitment to aggressively manage inventories in fiscal 2020 to provide a clean start to 2021. Looking at the fourth quarter, we continue to see signs of progress. Top line sales of $120 million improved sequentially compared to the third quarter, and each month within the quarter improved sequentially as well. While store traffic continued to trend meaningfully below prior year in the fourth quarter, with enclosed mall stores trailing lifestyle centers, customers that did cross the threshold converted better and responded well to full-priced product."

Gross margin of 57.0% includes 590 basis points related to aggressive action taken in the quarter to liquidate liable markdown products through third parties. Excluding the impact of these liquidations, gross margin was 62.9%, up compared to last year, driven by the strength in full price selling. We continue to focus on operating the business more efficiently. SG&A expenses were down $15 million compared to last year, driven by reductions in store-related selling costs and lower marketing spend."

Total liquidity, as defined in our covenant terms, measured as ending cash balance plus check float and ABL availability was $37.3 million as of the end of the fourth quarter, down compared to third quarter due to the normal cadence of cash usage this time of the year. Regarding tax, the CARES Act passed in March of 2020 permits tax losses to be carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years. We are currently preparing the required filings to obtain refunds by carrying back our current year tax loss and expect to receive a tax refund in excess of $25 million. Consistent with our debt agreements, we expect to apply these $25 million of this refund to pay down the priming term loan by August 30, 2021."

With visibility still low given the ongoing pandemic, we are not providing guidance at this time. We do, however, expect revenues to continue to recover in the first half as we anniversary temporary store closures related to the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020. We continue to focus on driving gross margin improvement supported by reduced inventory levels and better full price selling. Capital investment will increase to approximately $10 million, driven by a return to normalized capital maintenance levels and select investments in customer experience enhancing initiatives. And though we believe the store channel is a very important channel for J.Jill, we will continue to evaluate store performance post-pandemic and expect to close about 20 stores in 2021."

Earlier this afternoon, Salarius Pharmaceuticals issued a press release detailing its financial results for the 3 months and the full-year ended December 31, 2020, which we encourage listeners to read."
2462,en,1,929,1,0.431139,positive,1,positive,0.466089,"The press release can be found in the News section of Solaris arma.com. Salarius also filed a 10-K this afternoon, which is available on Salariuspharma.com and sec.gov. Before beginning today's call, I would like to make the following statement. Today, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements about future expectations, plans, events and circumstances including statements about our strategy, future operations and the development of our lead investigational drug candidate, seclidemstat, and our expectations regarding our capital allocation and cash resources. These statements are based on our current expectations, and you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Actual results may differ materially due to our risks and uncertainties and including those detailed in the Risk Factors section of Salarius Pharmaceuticals 10-K filed with the SEC and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time."

Today's call highlights an exciting time in the growth of Salarius. In just the past few weeks, we have achieved important clinical milestones in the development of our lead drug candidate, seclidemstat, and we have achieved significant milestones in financing Salarius."
2468,en,1,599,1,0.455721,positive,,positive,0.455722,"We have completed the dose escalation portion of the ewing sarcoma clinical trial and seclidemstat is now being investigated at the recommended Phase II dose in three distinct patient populations made up of viewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcomas, which, in the case of viewing-related sarcomas, include two patient populations made up of myxoid liposarcoma and other FET-translocated sarcomas. Each of these three patient groups, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma and FET-translocated sarcomas potentially represents a separate regulatory path to approval and the related commercial opportunity."
2469,en,1,433,1,0.76195,positive,,positive,0.74514,"These recent clinical milestones and the expansion of the viewing clinical trial to include Ewing's related sarcomas, further underpins and supports the first prong of our development strategy, speed to market. Salarius is now investigating three patient populations, each of which is supported by future clinical results, we believe has the potential for accelerated regulatory approval and supports our strategy of speed to market."
2470,en,1,455,1,0.910931,positive,,positive,0.9368,"In parallel, I'm very pleased to report that as a result of a series of financial transactions, Salarius now has the capital resources of approximately $37 million in available cash to fund our current clinical trials, while providing the ability to develop seclidemstat in larger market indications, including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. These larger market indications represent the second prong of our development strategy, expand the market."
2471,en,1,250,1,0.507775,positive,,positive,0.507775,"In addition to these clinical and financial achievements, we have also amended the Ewing clinical trial to expand the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population and improve patient access to seclidemstat earlier in the patient's treatment paradigm."
2472,en,1,304,1,0.755072,positive,,positive,0.755072,"By combining seclidemstat with the common second or third-line chemotherapy treatment, topotecan and cyclophosphamide, we hope to open the door to seclidemstat's potential use much earlier in a Ewing patient's treatment continuum as a second or third-line therapy, while improving their patient outcomes."
2473,en,1,274,1,0.705295,positive,,positive,0.70701,"Let me make sure I clearly communicated the importance of these developments. We believe we have integrated seclidemstat into the Ewing sarcoma standard of care, and seclidemstat can now be easily administered as a second or third-line therapy in our ongoing clinical trial."
2474,en,1,261,1,0.887096,positive,,positive,0.887096,"In addition to increasing the number of patients who can receive seclidemstat treatment, we believe that this also makes it easier for physicians to utilize seclidemstat early in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care, while potentially improving patient outcomes."
2475,en,1,607,1,0.638627,positive,,positive,0.638627,"Finally, in a small subset of Ewing-related sarcoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease, that enrolled in the advanced solid tumor trial, all patients in the subset showed indications of seclidemstat drug activity as evidenced by a medium time to progression that was greater or longer than a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. It is important to note that these indications of drug activity occurred at doses below the recommended Phase II dose that we are currently using in our ongoing Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trials."
2476,en,1,290,1,0.27745,positive,,positive,0.27745,"Again, to be clear, in a small subset of patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing-related sarcoma, we observed a median increase in the patient's time to progression when compared to a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in the advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting."
2477,en,1,406,1,0.563024,positive,1,positive,0.546346,"We believe this is exciting preliminary data of seclidemstat activity in Ewing-related sarcomas. I cannot understate our view regarding the importance of these developments to the ongoing growth of seclidemstat and Salarius, nor can I understate how well we believe this positions Salarius for the future. Mark and I look forward to speaking in detail about each of these accomplishments later in the call."
2478,en,1,398,1,0.87272,positive,,positive,0.848474,"However, before that, I would like to take a moment and provide my thoughts on the past 12 months. If you had asked me a year ago, if Salarius would be in the position of strength that we are now in, I would have responded with a resounding, absolutely. Why would I have said that? Because we had a well-defined strategy, and we executed on a plan that I fully expected will yield positive results."
2479,en,1,340,1,-0.441553,negative,1,negative,-0.377698,"Of course, this plan did not factor in the COVID-19 pandemic. In just a matter of days last March, the world was impacted by a once-in-a-generation situation. Salarius was not immune. But in spite of the many uncertainties, we were able to quickly make adjustments that enabled us to persevere in certain ways, become stronger as a company."
2480,en,1,380,1,0.821754,positive,,positive,0.821754,"This type of fortitude was especially evident in those who led and participated in our clinical trials, including our clinical development team, the investigators and staff at our cancer centers that are implementing our clinical trials and most importantly, the trial participants and their families who selflessly volunteered their time and energy despite these many challenges."
2481,en,1,315,1,0.715406,positive,,positive,0.794151,"For the patients with advanced cancers participating in our clinical trials, everyday activity suddenly became an even greater ordeal. Yet these patients were willing to participate in our trials, so that we could continue developing seclidemstat to all the past and current participants in our trial, we thank you."
2482,en,1,262,1,0.867088,positive,,positive,0.867088,"Later in today's discussion, I'll talk more about the positive impact of our recent clinical and financial milestone achievements and our plans to continuing developing seclidemstat for larger market indications, including solid tumors and hematological cancers."
2483,en,1,188,1,0.638977,positive,,positive,0.845446,"But now I would like to hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rosenblum, who will speak to our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. Mark, please go ahead."
2484,en,1,14,1,0.623415,positive,,positive,0.623415,Mark Rosenblum
2485,en,1,242,1,0.538939,positive,1,positive,0.524067,"Thank you, David. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, Salarius reported a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.9 million and $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009."
2486,en,1,584,1,-0.767609,negative,,negative,-0.778466,"For the full-year, Salarius reported a net loss of $7.4 million and $0.50 per basic and diluted share versus a loss of $6.9 million, or $2.12 per basic and diluted share for the prior year. The loss from operations before other income for the three months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $0.3 million compared to the loss from operations of overall $2.1 million for the same time spend last year, which was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in grant revenue and lower general and administrative costs, more than offsetting higher research and development expenditures."
2487,en,1,641,1,0.620153,positive,,neutral,0.0,"Increased research and development costs resulted from increased drug manufacturing costs. The decrease in general and administrative costs resulted from the absence of expenses related to Salarius' onetime transformation into a public company during 2019, which did not reoccur in the current period. This offsets higher personnel costs in the current period. Our December 31 balance sheet states the company had $11.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The balance sheet was strengthened in early 2021 as the company raised over $30 million from both the sale of our common stock and underwritten public offering and warrants exercises."
2488,en,1,359,1,0.884156,positive,,positive,0.805571,"We also received $0.9 million in non-dilutive secret financing during Q1 2021. Salarius has an additional $4.8 million under the secret Grant, and we expect to receive a portion of that amount in 2021. The results of these funding activities is that Salarius has currently available cash of approximately $37 million, our strongest financial position to date."
2489,en,1,127,1,0.77754,positive,,positive,0.77754,We believe Salarius has the financial resources available to advance our ongoing clinical trials through completion and beyond.
2490,en,1,48,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"With that, I'd like to return the call to David."
2491,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,David Arthur
2492,en,1,487,1,0.926372,positive,,positive,0.926876,"Thank you, Mark. As we have discussed, our goal as a company is to maximize the potential of seclidemstat, and by doing so, bring hope to patients and their families facing limited treatment options, while creating and building shareholder value. To that end, I would like to state that by midyear 2021 this year, we hope to have active clinical trials across 5 separate patient populations, evaluating seclidemstat as single-agent therapy and in up to 3 different combination therapies."
2493,en,1,596,1,0.823269,positive,,positive,0.808613,"As discussed earlier, completing the dose escalation stage of our Ewing sarcoma clinical trial is a major achievement. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of seclidemstat with secondary endpoints to assess the maximum tolerated dose, determine the recommended Phase II dose and measure antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. I am pleased to report that the dose escalation stage succeeded. Data demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile. The recommended Phase II dose for the expansion stage has been established."
2494,en,1,468,1,0.79789,positive,,positive,0.817835,"And importantly, pharmacokinetic data indicated that treatment at the recommended Phase II dose achieved human plasma concentrations above levels where seclidemstat demonstrated activity in preclinical or animal studies. We believe the data from this dose escalation trial is compelling. And for this reason, Salarius has submitted the full findings, including details on safety, dosing and initial efficacy signals for presentation at an upcoming oncology conference."
2495,en,1,378,1,0.453094,positive,,positive,0.884823,"Once the conference embargo lifts, we will be able to provide more detailed information. Again, please allow me to reiterate because it is important to state clearly. The dose escalation stage of the trial achieved all key endpoints. It demonstrated seclidemstat safety profile established a recommended Phase II dose, and we believe it provided early evidence of drug activity."
2496,en,1,498,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Although our dose escalation trial is primarily focused on establishing seclidemstat's safety, we believe, as we've stated, we observed preliminary evidence supporting seclidemstat's potential to treat advanced-stage cancer patients. Notably, these observations occurred in patients primarily treated at doses below the recommended Phase II dose in patients that were heavily pretreated with multiple prior treatment failures, and in patients who had relapsed or refractory disease upon enrollment."
2497,en,1,504,1,-0.604115,negative,,negative,-0.5521,"This preliminary evidence of drug activity was observed in a refractory Ewing sarcoma patient who is treated with single-agent seclidemstat for 6 28-day cycles and demonstrated more than a 75% tumor reduction in prospectively defined some of target lesions. However, despite this significant tumor reduction, a new non-target lesion appeared at the end of cycle 2, resulting in a classification of progressive disease as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, version 1.1 or RECIST 1.1."
2498,en,1,712,1,0.39314,positive,1,positive,0.427877,"Having said that, Salarius believes this data demonstrates preliminary single agent drug activity in a patient with refractory Ewing sarcoma, meaning disease, which had failed prior medical treatments responded to seclidemstat as single-agent therapy. This is especially encouraging, given the challenge in treating refractory disease and the fact that the patient received no other cancer treatment while taking seclude stat. Given the preliminary evidence of drug activity observed, Salarius believes there is a meaningful opportunity to introduce seclidemstat earlier in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care, which we believe will benefit patients and increase the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population."
2499,en,1,334,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Internal preclinical research suggests that Ewing sarcoma cell lines, seclidemstat has an additive effect, an additive effect when combined with the chemotherapy agents, topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This suggests the seclidemstat can be added to topotecan and cyclophosphamide and potentially improve upon current patient outcomes."
2500,en,1,284,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Additionally, because topotecan and cyclophosphamide de are commonly used as second or third-line treatment. Salarius can potentially increase the addressable patient population for seclidemstat by supporting doctors and patients use of seclidemstat earlier in the treatment paradigm."
2501,en,1,484,1,0.998595,positive,,positive,0.998595,"Based on these conditions, Salarius considerations, Salarius amended the dose expansion trial protocol so that Ewing sarcoma patients who have failed 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy may be treated with seclidemstat in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide as second or third-line therapy. This is an exciting development and one that aligns perfectly with our goal to increase our use of seclidemstat by exploring its potential as a treatment for a broader patient population."
2502,en,1,197,1,0.712776,positive,,positive,0.712776,"In addition to the Ewing sarcoma news, we believe we have seen encouraging clinical data from a small subset of viewing related sarcoma patients enrolled in the Salarius advanced solid tumor trial."
2503,en,1,803,1,0.554028,positive,1,positive,0.561812,"All patients in this subgroup had relapsed or refractory disease when enrolled in the trial, and all patients in this subset demonstrated signs of drug activity despite being treated with seclidemstat at doses below the recommended Phase II dose. Patients in this subgroup exhibited a median time to progression longer than a commonly-used benchmark for assessing single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. This is exactly -- and I want to repeat, this is exactly the type of data we were hoping to see to support seclidemstat's potential to treat these difficult viewing Ewing-related sarcomas and move forward with our strategy to expand in new patient populations, establish new potential paths to regulatory approval and pursue the related commercial opportunities."
2504,en,1,676,1,0.708987,positive,,positive,0.708987,"Salarius has now initiated the dose expansion stage of the Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trial, which was expanded to include up to 30 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma as well as up to 30 patients with sarcomas that share a similar biology to Ewing sarcoma. I've referred to these as Ewing-related sarcomas or FET translocated sarcomas. These Ewing-related sarcoma patients or patients with myxoid liposarcoma and other FET translocated sarcomas will continue to be treated with single-agent seclidemstaat and represent completely new addressable patient populations, each with the potential path regulatory approval and a potential commercial opportunity."
2505,en,1,213,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,The dose expansion portion of the Ewing and Ewing-related trial will continue to evaluate safety and antitumor activity in all participants with preliminary data readouts expected towards the end of 2021 and 2022.
2506,en,1,273,1,0.753539,positive,,positive,0.731633,"Salarius has also submitted findings from the advanced solid tumor trial, including details on safety, dosing and initial safety signals for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Once the conference embargo lifts, we will be able to provide even more information."
2507,en,1,358,1,0.972867,positive,,positive,0.972867,"In summary, we believe the clinical data collected thus far from the Ewing sarcoma trial and the ongoing advanced solid tumor trial has demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile, can be administered at doses that are clinically relevant, and we believe has provided evidence of drug activity in patient populations with advanced disease."
2508,en,1,232,1,0.909131,positive,,positive,0.909131,We believe that the clinical progress discussed today paints a promising picture of seclidemstat's potential as both a single agent and combination therapy for patients with hard-to-treat cancers in need of better treatment options.
2509,en,1,228,1,0.841893,positive,,positive,0.841893,Salarius and our clinical investigators are excited about the potential of seclidemstat to treat Ewing sarcoma patients earlier and the potential to treat these additional Ewing sarcoma patient -- Ewing-related sarcoma patients.
2510,en,1,464,1,0.522578,positive,1,positive,0.526909,"In addition -- and additionally, we believe there is a substantial unexplored potential ahead for seclidemstat, and we anticipate even more opportunities in 2021 to justify the use of seclidemstat in other underserved cancers. In that regard, Salarius has completed much of the necessary work to begin clinical trials in other cancer indications that align with seclidemstat's mechanism of action, and we look forward to announcing these trials in the near future."
2511,en,1,392,1,-0.567389,negative,,negative,-0.784796,"Areas of interest we have previously discussed include hematologic cancers and the use of seclidemstat in combination with immuno-oncology therapies, specifically checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapy treatment designed to unleash a human immune system attack on cancer cells. However, these drugs do not work in all cancer patients or in all cancer types."
2512,en,1,630,1,-0.26805,negative,1,positive,0.308028,"In addition, patients do not show an initial -- in addition, patients that do show an initial response can become resistant to the checkpoint inhibitor treatment and experience a return of the disease, commonly known as disease relapse. Interestingly, data from preclinical studies conducted by the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, and published in the peer review journal plus 1 last year demonstrated the potential of using seclidemstat in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to overcome cancer's ability to hide from the immune system and thereby unleash the immune system to attack the cancer."
2513,en,1,189,1,-0.486031,negative,,negative,-0.486031,"In simple terms, seclidemstat may turn tumors concealed from a patient's immune system called cold tumors, into hot tumors, our tumors, the immune system is able to identify and infiltrate."
2514,en,1,507,1,0.614917,positive,,positive,0.621372,"These now hot tumors could then respond to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. This provides a significant opportunity for seclidemstat because it could be used to treat patients with a wide variety of cancers that are currently unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors. As I said earlier, considering the data we have generated to date and the potential for additional data generation in ongoing clinical programs and soon to be announced additional clinical programs, these are exciting times for Salarius."
2515,en,1,222,1,0.674704,positive,,positive,0.674704,"Again, by midyear 2021 this year, we hope to have active clinical trials across 5 patient populations, evaluating seclidemstat as single agent therapy and evaluating seclidemstat in up to 3 different combination therapies."

So I just wanted to go back to Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcoma trial. So you have a combo with chemotherapy in second and third-line, and then you have a single agent for Ewing-related sarcomas in the third-line. So why did you decide not to combine Ewing-related sarcomas with chemo, just like you did with Ewing sarcoma itself?"

What we have observed in these patients as a single agent that those patients have failed those standard treatment and still had significant clinical activity."
2560,en,1,391,1,0.521478,positive,1,positive,0.486352,"So we want to further establish single-agent activity for the myxoid liposarcoma. And if we are able to show what we observed in the preliminary, I think, it will be a relatively a good path to regulatory approval as a single agent. We do have some internal discussions have been going on. So we are looking at further combinations as well, but we're not ready to disclose them at this time."

So it will be difficult to select a single or a couple of chemotherapy regimens that one would want to combine with."

Where does -- can you remind us what the standard of care stands for those 2 kind of groups of patients? Second, third-line in sarcoma and kind of third-line plus Ewing-related sarcoma.

The benchmark is around 5 to 6 months median PFS. For myxoid liposarcoma, in earlier lines of patients, now I remember, we have patients that have failed with standard treatment but in myxoid liposarcoma, the range of median PFS is around 3.5 to 4 months.

And based off the signal mentioned by David and Nadeem, is why we're now expanding the Ewing sarcoma trial to include these additional patients. So already, the FET solid tumor trial has given us an indication of patients that may respond better to seclidemstat."

2585,en,1,514,1,0.487336,positive,1,positive,0.509929,"Yes, happy to. So we have done in vitro experiments, combining the chemo regimen, topotecan and cyclophosphamide with seclidemstat and seen additivity. The mechanism there is topotecan and cyclophosphamide or DNA damage agents and LSD1 has been implicated as well in the DNA damage response. And it may also expose more DNA through its chromatin reconfiguration to the effects of DNA damage and agents. So we feel quite strongly about combining with topotecan and cyclophosphamide from a mechanistic point of view."
2586,en,1,243,1,0.480466,positive,,positive,0.480466,"But then also importantly, our safety profile does not have significant overlapping toxicity concerns with the chemo regimen, which means that moving forward in clinic, that's a good strategy as you don't have those overlapping talks concerns."
2587,en,1,167,1,-0.526225,negative,,negative,-0.526225,And I'll let David mention why we're taking the strategy of continuing to pursue single agent and some of the other Ewing-related sarcomas before combining with chemo?

We're going to follow the science and always try and do what's in the best interest of achieving the most positive in outcomes. So where we are now with the myxoid Ewing-related sarcomas, is we're following the results that we observed in the subset of patients. And we're fortifying those results with greater patient numbers. And by continuing in single agent therapy, as Nadeem mentioned earlier, if we see results that we're hoping to see, we could have potentially both a single agent and a combination therapy approach to treating those types of Ewing-related sarcomas."
2590,en,1,475,1,0.789084,positive,,positive,0.817747,"While this is going on, our -- we're working here in our lab internally to identify what chemotherapy agents might be the best combination choices should we decide and head that direction. So looking back to my how I started the answer to the question, we're keeping all options on the table. But right now, we like the fact that we're pursuing single agent therapy and see where that takes us, which sets up the option of having in a number of directions in the near future."

So LSD1 as a target has been well-validated for hem malignancies due to LSD1's role in blocking differentiation and then driving malignant cell growth. And we've seen other companies with LSD1 inhibitors showing clinical proof-of-concept in hem indications, specifically in AML."
2599,en,1,524,1,0.51398,positive,1,positive,0.568516,"At Salarius, what we've done is we studied seclidemstat in a variety of heme malignancies, AML, myelodysplastic syndrome. And we've seen that seclidemstat has an antiproliferative effect and also that it shows synergistic effects when combined with a commonly used agent in the space, azacitidine. And then as we mentioned before, one of the benefits of seclidemstat is that we have a manageable safety profile, and we have not seen significant heme talks that some of these other LSD1 inhibitors will often face in clinics."
2600,en,1,363,1,0.951959,positive,,positive,0.933448,"So we think the combination of our activity in the preclinical model, coupled with our advantage in terms of more manageable heme safety profile will give us an advantage in pursuing seclidemstat within the hematological malignancy indication.

The answer is, I'm constantly looking at all areas that will first support the development of seclidemstat and ensure that we are maximizing its potential for patients and ultimately, shareholders. We're -- we want to do is best for patients and create value for shareholders. Now having said that, we're approached constantly by other organizations that have seen our ability to develop assets and advance them.

So, the commentary that you gave in the press release on capacity and comps was pretty helpful, so appreciate that. Just wanted to get some insight on do you guys think that January was the trough here and then how are you sort of thinking about the business for the rest of the year and kind of which one is seeing the better recovery that STK or the Kona? Just kind of any sort of commentary on that would be helpful."

2692,en,1,431,1,0.823471,positive,,positive,0.785184,"Great. Sure. So, from what we've seen so far this year, I would agree that January was what I considered to be a transitional month. I think that in January, we did see the impact of pretty cold weather across the country and being in locations with only outdoor facilities was very challenging I would think. So, I believe starting in February that we saw a little bit better weather patterns and also the lifting of restrictions."
2693,en,1,419,1,0.76038,positive,,positive,0.74947,"So, what we've seen in January, February, and March has been an ongoing pattern of the restrictions being lifted. We also have some additional lifting coming up, for instance, New York is shortly going to be at 50%, which is a big market for us. We also have Vegas coming to 50% very soon. So, I would say that we're now on a more positive momentum going forward, particularly as the restrictions continue to be lifted."
2694,en,1,466,1,0.907262,positive,,positive,0.910704,"Relative to STK and Kona Grill, my experience so far since we've been in recovery mode is that both of them have done exceptionally well. Meaning that there's a lot of demands. I do believe that Kona Grill, because of its suburban exposure, just do very well, all seven days of the week, whereas STK, with less of business travellers and group dining is doing very well Thursday through Sunday. So, there's a little bit of a shift on how the customers use the brand."
2695,en,1,276,1,0.941861,positive,,positive,0.952089,"But overall, I believe that both brands have done extremely well, particularly as you look at the numbers that we reported for the month of March.

So, can you kind of walk through the cadence of new openings and if they're going to be licensed or company-operated, and then also the 13 units you expect to open here in 2021, how many of them are Kona Grills?"

2699,en,1,358,1,0.828045,positive,,positive,0.803837,"So, the cadence is -- just to reiterate, we opened Scottsdale STK, which is doing fantastic as you probably saw the numbers on the press release and as we discussed here. So, we've been very happy with that and so that opened January 4th. The next opening that we're having will be probably Bellevue, Washington, which is the next one that we have scheduled."

Obviously, the U.K. is still currently not allowing for indoor dining. I believe that they are -- or at least they were planning to go to outdoor dining in April, then going to dining in May. So, we probably will open those U.K. locations in June or slightly later, depending on when the restrictions get lifted there."

So, as you've seen, sort of, capacity restrictions ease and things get a little bit better, have you guys had any trouble bringing on more employees, whether it's bartenders, waiters, or chefs or anything like that, have you guys faced any sort of headwinds there as capacity has begun to tick back up here?"

Obviously, we're monitoring very closely the fact that unemployment benefits have once again been extended. And last time when that happened, it was a little bit more difficult to staff some of the positions, so clearly, we will benefit. I will, I should say, we actually will monitor that condition very closely."
2711,en,1,425,1,0.630739,positive,1,positive,0.623855,"I will tell you though the thing that we have seen those the people who are in the restaurants now are staying, so we've seen a decrease -- a relative decrease in turnover and retentions have gone up. So, I would say that's probably the offset to maybe some of those future pressures on getting people in as that the people who are working for us seem to stay with the company. So, I'm very bullish about the retention trend."
2712,en,1,215,1,0.769081,positive,,positive,0.773551,"And I also think the fact that our operations have been very busy, I think the employees that are working in the restaurants feel very, very good about being in an active environment. So, I get a lot of compliments."

2721,en,1,444,1,0.893145,positive,,positive,0.895039,"Thank you. Three questions. But they're all around the same idea of optimization. So, ask them the best that I can. But I'm thinking first about the guest behavior and things you've had to do to modify? And then of course what used to be normal. So, how do you optimize getting in the perfect guest in the door and optimize the facility? Is that day a week, day part, entrée mix, food versus alcohol? How are you thinking about optimizing that?"

2723,en,1,312,1,0.893796,positive,,positive,0.873155,"So, that's a great question, Nicole. I think the way that we think is -- I told you a year and a half ago that things like selling the incremental drink at the table and selling the dessert at the table were something that we looked forward, because that would increase the per person average spend at the table."
2724,en,1,303,1,0.635071,positive,,positive,0.607128,"I think in today's environment, we think more of table turn. So, we really think about getting you in and out at an STK in 90 minutes. And for Kona Grill, we target 75. So, I think it's more of the new reality is that it's all about table turns and getting people to -- particular the dinner timeframes."
2725,en,1,432,1,0.898242,positive,,positive,0.898242,"And then the other paradigm that's different is that even for a fine dining type of business like STK, where in the past, we would have looked at maybe brunch as a non-core business, we now look at brunch as a core business, because now it allows us to use less seats on a Sunday and on a Saturday, which are very high demand days. So, I think that brunch now is playing a key role in kind of how we think of the business long-term."
2726,en,1,300,1,0.585171,positive,1,positive,0.449651,"And then last but not least, I think, from an operations and execution perspective, our teams spend a lot more time just measuring and monitoring the steps of service at the table.

2727,en,1,312,1,0.730786,positive,,positive,0.752546,"So, a very disciplined approach to bringing in the steps of service at the exact times, and obviously, we'll always have to balance that with the fact that we don't want to diminish the experience with the gap. So, it's really balancing the need for turns with need for a smile and move on [ph] a separate table."

So, that's super helpful. But how did you optimize like, less capital-intensive license throwing off cash flow opportunity, with STK big box big revenue with the Kona mainstream, but a lot of whitespace? How did you go through that process in these conditions to optimize that?"
2730,en,1,13,1,-0.505995,negative,,negative,-0.505995,Manny Hilario
2731,en,1,282,1,-0.502137,negative,,negative,-0.502137,"I think a couple of things. So, on the development side, it's what I'm seeing from an optimization perspective, if you will, is that particularly for F&B hotel operators, I'm seeing with the lower occupancy rates, they're less -- we -- less willing to take the risk on the F&B side."
2732,en,1,529,1,0.406884,positive,,negative,-0.793173,"What I mean by that is that the last thing they want to do is take a business that already has low occupancy and potentially low RevPAR and throwing their high risk, if you will, restaurants or F&B operations and particularly, if there are a shop that uses lots of labor for F&B. so, I'm seeing a lot of people wanting to optimize their F&B footprint by bringing in people that can execute the F&B program at a very high economic or very -- or I would actually say very profitable economics for them, so I see optimization there."
2733,en,1,325,1,0.90718,positive,,positive,0.90718,"And then the other thing that we see on the optimizations, some of the hotels that we're in, because of the velocity and the fact that our restaurants are very full on Fridays and Saturdays, we become an amenity to the property where people would want to come to the hotel and stay overnight because it's so fun and exciting."
2734,en,1,268,1,0.906814,positive,,positive,0.906814,"I'm thinking, for instance, the W in LA is an example where we're at that hotel and we have, frankly, become as the hotel management, they will tell us, one of the key strengths of their business because we're actually super active and bring a lot of excitement there."
2735,en,1,417,1,0.87459,positive,,positive,0.84519,"In terms of Kona Grill growth relative to development, as I said earlier, we're being very, very careful about making sure that the first Kona Grill that we do is a super homerun. So, we've been very disciplined about the entry in real estate that we have received tremendous amounts of opportunities from existing landlords who now want us to look at other projects and see if there is an opportunity for Kona Grill."
2736,en,1,433,1,0.731427,positive,,positive,0.755246,"I have seen them starting to begin to offer much more TIs on the Kona Grill, so almost going to a point where they're telling you they could almost build a property for us. But frankly, right now, because of where we're at on the pipeline with STK, and there's so much demand there for that product, we are focusing on it. And obviously, we will only take any kind of look at a Kona Grill if it's an extraordinary level of economics."
2737,en,1,277,1,-0.464437,negative,,negative,-0.408662,"So, I don't know if that answers your question, but certainly tells you that there's a lot of demands and we certainly want to focus on where there is higher level of returns and we certainly don't want to take any opportunities that we feel are not high revenue opportunities."

Last one, I'm going to leave it open-ended, purposely so answer or not whatever drops in, but how do you optimize your balance sheet? I mean that could -- I'll just leave it at that. It ties together with the other parts. Thanks."

2741,en,1,633,1,0.737332,positive,,positive,0.738851,"Yes, I mean, I think right now optimizing the balance sheet is I think, emphasizing store level economics. I mean ultimately, in the restaurant business, that's how you ultimately really build your balance sheet is by having a world-class economics. And I think if you start looking at it -- look at our -- if you look at our same-store performance for STK, and unit economics back in new stores in Scottsdale at $180,000 weekly levels, our unit economics are super-compelling. So, our restaurants, at those volumes of those levels of revenue become super profitable. So, that's ultimately our long-term strategy to bring in capital."
2742,en,1,378,1,0.960123,positive,,positive,0.95086,"And as I said earlier in my comments about development, I think that the success of the brands today excites landlords and developers. So, having an exciting brands that are great amenities to projects to me is, frankly, the ultimate balance sheet builder because we will be able to get amazing deals and create a tremendous amount of cash flow with very little capital outlays."
2743,en,1,301,1,0.747659,positive,,positive,0.73885,"So, that's how I look at the short-term capital view in this and then hopefully, as we continue building profitability, we'll be able to work out the cost of debt and other cost of capital in our balance sheet. So, ultimately, that's our really long-term -- longer term strategy for the balance sheet."
2744,en,1,172,1,0.90266,positive,,positive,0.93968,"So, focused on store margins, keep managing G&A super tightly, and then ultimately, keep developing on asset light. So, that's our basic strategy that we've been following."

2752,en,1,474,1,0.828875,positive,1,positive,0.536568,"All right. Thank you for taking my questions. I had a couple. To start, can you give us a bit more color on the capacity constraints? I know you mentioned that STK typically has more demand on the Thursday to Sunday window. But are restaurants actively turning down potential guests use space limitations? And so what's the demand pressure effectively seen? And is there a sense of implied capacity that restaurants have hit without coronavirus-related capacity constraints?"
2753,en,1,13,1,-0.505995,negative,,negative,-0.505995,Manny Hilario
2754,en,1,350,1,0.610898,positive,1,positive,0.657068,"I mean, so I would answer that question by saying that on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, particularly between 6:30 and 9:30 in the evening, I would say that all of our restaurants are receiving lots more demand that we can fulfill in that timeframe. So, yes, so in those timeframes, I would say that we have received extraordinary amount of demand."
2755,en,1,303,1,0.514708,positive,1,positive,0.447503,"And frankly, our strategy has been through our -- how we book reservations. And how even we market, we try to shift all the -- a lot of that volume to the 9:30 to 11 timeframe, and then try to also shift some of the volume to the 5:30 frame. So, the answer is yes, those days are absolutely no problems."
2756,en,1,261,1,0.583778,positive,,positive,0.606897,"I do believe though that on the Mondays through Wednesdays, where historically, there were more business travellers, there's more conventions, there were more business type of activities, I think those are the days that we probably have more available capacity."
2757,en,1,434,1,0.774346,positive,,positive,0.749875,"So, what we've done in those days, if you're following what we do on marketing is, we've been doing a tremendous amount of social type of activities, like date nights, on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, because that's one of the occasions that we see super high demand for right now. So, we're marking for that and I think that actually has been successful to fill in for some of the lack of demand from the business opportunities."
2758,en,1,15,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Abhishek Malani
2759,en,1,255,1,0.877228,positive,,positive,0.858508,"Awesome and going into a second question, slightly different. Can you give us a sense on what percentage of sales are coming from like, drinks versus entrées in this period versus in the pre-COVID period? Is there any difference here that we haven't seen?"
2760,en,1,13,1,-0.505995,negative,,negative,-0.505995,Manny Hilario
2761,en,1,438,1,-0.486895,negative,1,negative,-0.476945,"Yes, so I will say that, historically, pre-COVID, our liquor sales would be a 30% plus range, whereas in the COVID period, we've been in between 25% and 30% on liquor and wine. I will tell you that pre-COVID with a number of being a little bit less than 30%, I would have been very concerned. But in the post-COVID, considering that when you sell more drinks, particularly at the table, you tend to slow down your turn times at the table."
2762,en,1,307,1,0.798289,positive,,positive,0.687564,"So, in our higher volume restaurants, particularly between Friday -- on Friday, Saturday, and Sundays, although we'd like to sell liquor because that's good margin, we will trade having more turns on the table than holding a table back for an extra 30 minutes or two, and the waiters [ph] can have a drinks."
2763,en,1,197,1,-0.654752,negative,,negative,-0.654752,"So, a lot of the reason why the liquor mix might be a little bit less is because we are actually driving a different strategy to try to drive more traffic and bring more people through table turns."
2764,en,1,406,1,0.344106,positive,,positive,0.344106,"So, I done think, per se, I guess what I'm trying to not make the correlation is that we have less liquor sales, because we're in COVID, I don't think it's that, per se, it's -- I think it's a combination of the strategy of turning the tables and also the fact that some of the areas, we're still not able to use bar, which used to be also a place where people would come in just to have one or two drinks."
2765,en,1,266,1,0.440498,positive,,positive,0.791317,"So, I think the combination of that is what drives it down. But if you look at our -- in general, if you look at our historical results, we've actually been very well managing crowds and I don't think that that's really a big material impact for us in the long-term."

2767,en,1,246,1,0.617634,positive,1,positive,0.620021,"Great. And one last question from me. First off, congratulations on the takeout and delivery execution. I was wondering here do we have a sense on what percent of these deliveries and takeout orders are from the current customers versus new adds?"
2768,en,1,13,1,-0.505995,negative,,negative,-0.505995,Manny Hilario
2769,en,1,310,1,0.856243,positive,,positive,0.882583,"So, that's a fantastic question. So, -- because we're very early on the strategy, actually a large proportion of our transactions are new transactions we've been very actively promoting. So, we're still in early stages of heavily promoting it. So, I would say that a big portion of it is just new transactions."
2770,en,1,265,1,0.89543,positive,,positive,0.89543,"For instance, we've used some of the -- for instance, we use the cheeseburger as a key product to drive interest for STK. And when I say cheeseburger, I mean, a Wagyu Cheeseburger, probably the best -- one of the best hamburgers -- or cheeseburgers in the industry."
2771,en,1,219,1,-0.498381,negative,,negative,-0.498381,"So, we're using promoting to bring people in. And so I think, at least in the early stages where we're at on takeout and delivery, I would say that over 50% of the traffic is still coming from people trying the product."
2772,en,1,337,1,0.986934,positive,,positive,0.982455,"And frankly, I looked at as a huge opportunity because as I talk to our teams here, our trick is to make sure that through great experience and takeout and delivery, we convert those to long-term loyal customers. So, I see that as a great opportunity to really build a very robust takeout business and delivery business in the long-term."

2774,en,1,183,1,-0.677488,negative,,negative,-0.677488,"I'm sorry to quickly add, so do you think there's any meaningful difference in the types of customers who are doing takeout and delivery versus the customers that are coming in-store?"
2775,en,1,13,1,-0.505995,negative,,negative,-0.505995,Manny Hilario
2776,en,1,257,1,0.737241,positive,,positive,0.784473,"I think that they are -- lots of them are the same customers, but different occasions. So, they're -- it's a more casual occasion. So, I would say -- and it's also a mix of new people who are looking at the different products on the takeout/ delivery menus."
2777,en,1,374,1,0.850114,positive,,positive,0.807836,"And if you follow our menus, they tend to be lower price points. So, it's also an opportunity for other guests to try the brand. So, I think we're basically doing both, we're serving existing restaurants -- I mean existing customers for different occasion, and bring a tremendous amount of customers with a lower price points, particular STK, to introduce them to the brand."
2778,en,1,304,1,0.968552,positive,,positive,0.968552,"And we're totally okay with that because as we tell the team here is let them try with the takeout menu and then when they have the birthday or the special date, or the -- or any other holiday, which is one of our areas that we do very well, they'll remember us and they'll give us a nod on the holidays."
2779,en,1,165,1,0.832851,positive,,positive,0.676967,"So, we look -- or special occasions. So, we look even at the consumer that may not be a primary STK consumer, as a potential consumer on a special occasion later on."

We are continuing our investments in delivering an enterprise-grade platform and the ecosystem to which it connects to enable organizations to drive greater net value from their cloud investments. Specifically, this means deepen our investments in strategic alignments with Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Adobe, and AWS among others, so organizations can move faster and achieve more across the value chain."

Recently, we have expanded our product offerings to include new products and packaging structures that provide us with new ways to monetize more of our user base. This is a trend we expect to continue. As it does, focusing on licensed users will understate our increasing ability to monetize our user base.

First, the Smartsheet business has diversified across segments, verticals and geographies with customer ARRs that range in size from a few hundred dollars to several million dollars. Second, our customer spending priorities grow and scale well with our solutions, and we will continue to invest in this opportunity. Third, with rapid innovation in our proprietary features and our M&A over the past couple of years, we have significantly widened our competitive moat.

But you mentioned in your prepared remarks a little bit on the evolution of the solution strategy, and I was just wondering if you can maybe expand for us a little bit what the changes you are making to the solutions are and how – maybe how should we think about the impact that will have on your pricing strategy for some of those accelerators and other value-based capabilities?"

2870,en,1,788,1,0.738844,positive,,positive,0.73809,"Yes. Arjun, I think we'll take this as a two-parter, so I'll answer – I have a couple of comments, and I’ll let Gene cover off. So I think two things we're trying to do is, is respond to customer signal. And when I think about what we did with accelerators in prior years, solving for very specific use cases, really letting people take advantage of this composite of our dashboards and our sheets and our reports and our forms, people like those. But the things that we're seeing is we're scaling further in the enterprise is a different set of needs. It can be on the dimension of scale and control, things for which we're actually developing proprietary IP. So technology is being built. It's way beyond just the configuration of a solution. So I'll let Gene speak to that in a second."
2871,en,1,543,1,0.930921,positive,,positive,0.921019,"The second piece around packaging and pricing, that's very important. Over the last few years as we've created more and more capabilities, we have this ever-growing portfolio of things, and people want simplicity in how they engage with us. So for us to get our median sales rep to be able to sell quickly and confidently and let customers to be able to react to that well, there needs to be a simplicity in the offer. And that's what we're achieving now with the change in packaging as well as with this newly enhanced set of offerings. Gene?"
2872,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Eugene Farrell
2873,en,1,708,1,0.885037,positive,,positive,0.85055,"Yes. Building on Mark's comments, it's really a shift that we've taken based on customer signal where – on the solutions side, customers are looking for the ability to really tailor solutions more precisely to their individual business needs, and they're looking for the ability that when they license a set of capabilities, being able to apply those capabilities across multiple use cases is a functional area. So for example, in marketing, we have an accelerator for event management, customers are saying, “Hey, what I'd really like is to be able to license a set of capabilities that will support marketing event management and campaign management and creative content development,” and the list goes on."
2874,en,1,399,1,0.725785,positive,,positive,0.775691,And so what we've essentially done is look to a new packaging approach that takes our premium capabilities that will still be available as a la carte or individual capabilities. But we're now also offering them in a bundle or a package of premium platform capabilities that our customers can license at a significant discount or a value when they license the package versus buying them individually.
2875,en,1,650,1,0.692418,positive,,positive,0.724132,"And by positioning that platform, it really enables us to grow with less friction within customers because they then have the entire platform to be able to build on top of. And then it also changes how we monetize because we've actually priced that premium offering based on the number of connected users to the actual platform. And so a company that has Smartsheet deployed within a department can license it at a price point that is commensurate with the value that they get at the department level. As they expand and add more connected users across the enterprise, renewal that will then relicense or expand that customer at a higher price point."

But after being in the CFO seat for 90 days now, it would be great if you can share with us some of your early observations about the business overall as a newer member of the leadership team.

The first one is, you always hear the word TAM, and you have to actually feel it. So as I joined Smartsheet, actually using the product and figuring how it could work and actually did work was just a realization of that opportunity. You can see the TAM – you can see the TAM at play. I couldn't be in any more Zoom calls and get the work done."
2880,en,1,705,1,0.784622,positive,,positive,0.793197,"The second one is, as I dug into the business, I have confidence in the business. I believe the opportunity is here. The long-term opportunity is our focus and our near-term investment should help us unlock it. So I believe that. And then the last part of it is the leadership team. I think for every opportunity, the leadership team is what unlocks it, and as I've gone through this year of experienced leadership team that really knows how to take advantage of it and scale into that opportunity. So those are my three quick observations. The second part of your question was on metrics changing. We're not changing any metrics other than the one I specifically called out as a part of our housekeeping."

And also, I did like the disclosure around the larger enterprises with 10,000 plus employees. That was very helpful. I had two questions after all of that there. Mark, I tend to ask about where we are in just kind of the market itself, the collaborative work management market and its evolution. You'll have a lot more capabilities now, you have no-code apps, you have Bridge, you have all these other things that are kind of infrastructure oriented for enterprises. Are you seeing as we went through calendar 2020 and how you think about 2021, are you seeing much larger landings when you get into a new enterprise for the first time that you hadn't touched before or is the initial acquisition kind of size, is it changing much?

So if you have someone who really wants to accelerate right out of the gate and want to consume a premium platform thing with Brandfolder included and fully digitized a large workflow, they can do so. But I would say that the ability for them to maintain that optionality still remains critical. We still see evidence of teams within large departments at really large companies wanting to have that earned enterprise approach. So it's important as we come up with these new offerings, we're not forcing the customer's hand, we're giving them an option."

Maybe you can talk about, Mark, what is it that you think is the biggest bottleneck you have right now in taking these 2,800 customers that have 10,000 employees plus that on average spend with you, I don’t know, $40,000 and getting them into $0.25 million and $0.50 million?

But if you don't have the mechanisms, the sales muscle, the advisory service, the sort of a journey mapping for the customer, you're putting an intense amount of pressure on your prospect to your customer to figure that out on their own. So as we look at leaning in on our large enterprise team build-out, both with quota-carrying reps and with advisory services, those are things that we think are fundamental. So I would say, the bottleneck or the opportunity for growth is really in building that team out. I think we're doing all the right things on the platform piece to make it happen, but it's really building the team and also enabling partners to contribute to it."

We appreciate the additional disclosure on the large customer side, whereas that number breaks out closer to 140%. Can you just expand on the large customer expansion opportunity that $1.4 billion ARR opportunity you're highlighting, how you're defining that and how you effectively prioritize penetrating that from a product and go-to-market perspective?"

The way we discussed the opportunities, we said, we have 2,800 customers today who have more than 10,000 employees are already customers of ours. We have 41 of those who pay us greater than $0.5 million in annual recurring revenue. If I took the remaining population base and converted them all over to $500,000 and you did the math, you would come up with $1.4 billion. That's the way we did the opportunity sizing. Mark, I’ll pass over to you."

I think in terms of the go-to-market, I think a big part of this is, is really marrying a very strong land and expand motion with an opinionated sales approach. So if we go into a larger customer that we know has significant needs across automation, customer enablement, planning, these are the things that we can come in with a solution set. We can assign a significant ROI to it, which would command a more significant level of investment. So I think the path to getting from 41 – over $0.5 million contributors to dramatically increasing that is to have more of those pairings of the top-down guiding advisory, examining how we can best help, paired with that bottom up. And that's something which again, we're developing right now. A few years ago, it didn't exist at our company if the muscle has been built and now we need to scale."

Mark, first on the competitive landscape, I wanted to get an update on your thinking? And in particular, I think about how the market may unfold as it relates to RPA. Right now, you indicated you signed a recent partnership with UiPath, but how do you think that particular segment has the risk or opportunity of overlapping in the next couple of years?"

2939,en,1,798,1,0.552733,positive,,positive,0.51939,"Yes. Hi, Keith. I think that – yes, the question is really around where do we see RPA playing out around relative to our capabilities. And in doing the agreement with UiPath, it was really driven by a signal from – that both companies were receiving from customers where their workflows in modern enterprise that really cross between the more, what I'll call, routine kind of on-rails structured work into unstructured dynamic work, where you need to – you have a degree of variability that machines are not going to be able to adapt for and customer desire to be able to take workflows that maybe start in that structured space and they're using RPA to improve efficiency and throughput, and then be able to pass those off to an unstructured or dynamic workflow that's being managed at Smartsheet."
2940,en,1,663,1,0.504837,positive,1,positive,0.469763,"And I think you can actually work both ways. You can start in the unstructured side and move to structured and vice versa. I think your question is really around how do we see those converging. Well, I think there will be increasing marriage between those technologies as more and more companies find ways to leverage machine intelligence to really eliminate what I call kind of the no-brainer workflows that today are being done by humans mainly because systems can't talk to each other very well. I think that's very different than what's happening in the unstructured space where you really have to have that ability to adapt and change really, really quickly."
2941,en,1,216,1,0.680775,positive,,positive,0.918046,And so I don't think there's ever a complete overlap. I think it's really a nice marriage going forward. And our goal is to be positioned as the platform of choice to be able to support the unstructured side of work.

2943,en,1,581,1,0.755799,positive,1,positive,0.627488,"Okay. That makes perfect sense to me. The second question is on increasing your dollar penetration rates. If you look even at your largest customers, your dollar percent of spend per customer is still relatively low, and while it's been coming up nicely, I'm just wondering how that moves more rapidly. And the area that I wanted to focus on is both the Accelerator strategy and the capability-based projects that you talked about in marketing as an example. But how do you think about that unfolding over the next two years to try to increase your dollar penetration, so to speak?"
2944,en,1,306,1,0.31712,positive,1,positive,0.31712,"So in other words, if you look at accelerators now as a percent of your billings and you combine that two years from now with the marketing-based capabilities plus the extended family, how do you think that changes?

2946,en,1,509,1,0.33524,positive,1,positive,0.278856,Yes. So let me kind of break this down. I think there's really a couple of different elements to it. I think it starts with some of the things Mark talked about around how do we be more intentional and more opinionated in helping customers accelerate their journey. COVID has provided this amazing opportunity where companies are realizing that they kind of business as usual in the way they've been operating for years. It’s likely not going to be the preferred way to operate as we come out of the pandemic.
2947,en,1,406,1,0.794098,positive,,positive,0.821651,"And so there's a real catalyst for folks to rethink and companies to rethink how they're operating. So I think us being positioned to really help guide them on that journey through our sales and support services, is probably at the tip of the sphere. To support that, I think there's really two key elements of our offerings. The first is in the platform – premium platform capabilities we’ve talked about."
2948,en,1,538,1,0.500521,positive,1,positive,0.499567,"One of the things we've learned over time with customers is that when you sell against a specific solution or a specific need, customers drive a lot of value from that. But then many times immediately say, hey, this works so well here, I want to go pivot to the next use case. And when they just licensed a subset of our platform, they're not always able to solve for that beautifully. So we have to come back and relicense or it creates friction in the process which slows down expansion and their ability to drive value from Smartsheet."
2949,en,1,953,1,0.900714,positive,,positive,0.894468,"So shifting to a more holistic premium platform approach, we think really is going to take the brakes off of our customer's ability to extend Smartsheet and the value we create across the enterprise more quickly and solve for a broader set of use cases in a lower friction way. The third thing, I would mention is Work Apps and the no-code capabilities that that introduces. We are seeing really positive signal from customers. It’s still very early, and there's a lot of – lot that we're bringing to market over the course of this year to really enable Work Apps to be deployed at scale and manage at scale. But we really see that ability to create curated experiences around workflows and specific use cases as truly differentiating and really empowering because it's a true no-code platform where business users are able to build and configure these solutions and deploy them really, really quickly, and then modify or adjust when businesses present."
2950,en,1,205,1,0.837403,positive,,positive,0.837403,"So I think the combination of the intentional and advisory go-to-market with our platform and our Work Apps capabilities, I think they are really the key to accelerating that journey to large ARR customer."

If I think back a couple of quarters ago, it seemed to me like the transactional business was really healthy. The enterprise stayed fairly strong, but there was kind of a blip with expansion of customers in the middle, right? And I think the numbers would suggest you're seeing some recovery in Q4. But I just want to ask explicitly about kind of what you're seeing with that expansion business in the middle customer cohort. And if it is, in fact, getting better, was it just time and recovery? Or is there something that you did to kind of affect change there?"

So if we had – we’re down about 15% to 20% from what we saw in Q2, and that's a really good indicator. So I look at velocity as a really important factor. And it's not just velocity of the over 10,000 employees, it's all the way down to emerging companies. So that's a really positive trait that we're able to monitor. So I think the – in terms of the number of transactions, I think, we’re – that the ability to simplify one's offerings, I think are a huge, huge input to achieving a different result. I do think macro is important too. We are still coming out of COVID, where hopefully vaccinations continue to go smoothly."

Almost every company has an element of project program, process management, and it's something – that's a significant use case for us today, but an area where the work we're doing with 10,000 feet and Smartsheet, we think, and some of the newer stuff that's in the pipeline, we have a real opportunity to disrupt there and really deliver pretty transformational experience for our customers that really moves away from a lot of the limitations of kind of the legacy platforms in that space.

I'm wondering how tangible maybe are any signs that this whole category of collaborative work management, perhaps it wasn't the immediate pandemic response category, but that – maybe it was something that was just destined to happen a little later in the cycle. And companies have a little more time to think about getting work done outside of Zoom, as Pete referenced. And maybe they're getting a little more visibility into the distribution of their workforces, how it'll settle out. So I guess I'm just wondering is there something beyond kind of macro recovery to the prior glide path and maybe a little extra spending wave that you might be seeing developing here?"

They’re sort of an upper bound to what people can handle. I mean, I am on Zoom a lot and I would say it's an essential part of my day, but I also recognize, and I think customers are recognizing that is not the only tool that we can lean on to actually conduct business. So I think this notion of asynchronous work, the ability to track something, mechanize something and not have to rely on a live conversation is very important. I think we are – as we talked about a couple of earnings calls ago, we talked about the phases, right? Phase one was react, support, make sure people are safe, synchronous, synchronous, synchronous. And now we're entering that phase of async is absolutely here and people are going to make investments in it."

One of the really big milestones for us was getting the IL-4 provisional authorization. We're going through the technical work to actually get the platforms connected now, so we can move to serving our first IL-4-based customer. And I think that sets a really good foundation for selling next year, right. So that's both on the agency side that sort of the – on the military side, as well as defense side, as well as on the non-defense agency front. So have high expectations for that again."
3021,en,1,498,1,0.742081,positive,,positive,0.747889,"I think in other growth markets for us, Pete alluded to the extension of our cloud platform over in Europe. We're seeing opportunity with larger cap European companies who I would say are more conservative around the data residency front. And I think having done all the work on moving to public cloud last year, the lift we have to achieve that this year is a far less. Still a lift, but we are really well positioned for that. So I would highlight those as probably the two biggest opportunities."

3041,en,1,484,1,0.702723,positive,,positive,0.711314,"Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could kind of unpack the billings guidance for the full-year a little bit, obviously you're guiding to a nice reacceleration off of the growth you put up this year. And I imagine you're assuming churn rates kind of improve. There's probably some impact from the acquisition you made. But maybe just help us understand kind of what are the bigger factors driving that improved outlook, particularly the accelerated trajectory?"

3043,en,1,465,1,0.861125,positive,,positive,0.869731,"So we were really pleased with our billings performance in Q4, and it spoke to some of the indicators that are important to this business. As we’re thinking about this business in fiscal year 2022, there's two elements that are important. As you think of billings, you should think of them as renewals, expansions and new business. So we are feeling really bullish on the expansions and new business based on our Q4 performance and the trend we're carrying forward."
3044,en,1,667,1,0.581435,positive,,positive,0.758143,"On the renewals that creates – renewals from last year are based on bookings that we did in fiscal year 2021, which represents a renewable opportunity for us in fiscal year 2022 and therefore billings in fiscal year 2022. We look at that headwind we had in, what I call fiscal year 2021, and that's going to play itself out into our billings for fiscal year 2022. So on the sum of it, I would say, really positive on the new business and expansion billings and a headwind on the billings from last year that carry forward. Now that headwind will probably be more manifest in the first half of the year rather than the full-year and then sort of ease out or normalize."

Our total revenue for the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter was $436.7 million, an increase of 24.4% compared to last year. Exceptional strength in our equipment business was the main driver of the strong revenue results in our fourth quarter, which increased 34.7%.

This past fall's harvest was quite different, as weather conditions allowed for a much quicker harvest with less stress on equipment. As a result, parts sales were down 4.7% and service was up 4.5% in our current year fourth quarter."

As a result, we experienced a 260 basis point compression in our rental fleet dollar utilization from 25% in the fourth quarter last year to 22.4% in the current quarter. Rental revenue was also down due to a smaller fleet size where we ended the year at $77.5 million compared to $104.1 million in the prior period."

But the mix of sales, which favored equipment, caused our gross profit margin to decrease by 190 basis points to 15.5%. Our operating expenses were essentially flat at $60.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021."
3117,en,1,301,1,0.756531,positive,,positive,0.752234,"Flat expenses coupled with the strong revenue growth we experienced generated significant operating leverage during the quarter.

Floorplan and other interest expense decreased $1 million to $1.5 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment, a lower interest rate spread under our new amended credit agreement that was finalized in April 2020 and lower borrowings on our line of credit."

Agriculture segment sales increased 40.7% to $303.2 million, which drove a significant increase in our adjusted pre-tax income to $8 million in the fourth quarter, which is a $5.5 million improvement from the $2.5 million we generated last year. Strong equipment sales, combined with lower floor plan interest expense drove the robust increase in adjusted pre-tax income."

You referenced some supply chain challenges. If you could speak to that and when you think inventories will normalize?

We do have as we mentioned a good inflow of presales coming in a nice amount of late-model used inventory on hand. Lease returns that will be coming back throughout the year as well as our current inventories and then our Q4 order book that opens soon here. So we're positioned well. We feel good. Obviously, there are some supply chain disruptions, as you mentioned a lot of them due to COVID, some of them due to the fairly rapid uptick in the commodity prices.

So with the higher level of revenues that we're expecting on the new what happens is that some of these bigger-ticket items the combines the four-wheel drives. So even in a tighter environment those big-ticket items typically don't garner the same level of margins that some of the smaller lower-priced equipment is. So that is a little bit of the lower results for the quarter was on that and some of our expectations for next year."

I mean, I don't think anybody expects your fiscal '22 and this calendar 2021 to be huge construction year per se, but still looks a little conservative, given the segments like housing and ag, which you play into look a bit more favorable. So what's holding that back? And I would think we have -- obviously have an easier comp on the energy side too which could potentially be a little bit better. So what's holding back better construction performance at this point?"

And our targets are the small to midsized construction equipment which is -- tends to -- I think the expectation a little bit higher. But infrastructure builds too. A lot of unknowns in there and the timing of when that could potentially happen with the stuff. So, again, I think we're guiding pretty much in line with the industry and we're optimistic into that segment. But it's a little bit going to be a timing on both the COVID and the oil starting to pick up. There's still a little bit of caution out there and how long is that going to last? And where is all this energy going to go? So, I think in the most part, we're in line and we're optimistic."

I know you mentioned, technology upgrades, but we have an old fleet. And when growers are coming in to buy equipment, are they coming in more for the tech upgrades or more because they need to replace older equipment? And also, can you talk about take rates on these higher tech piece of equipment this season versus maybe last season? How much more of that higher tech stuff are they taking this year?"

It is a mix of tax purchasing, as well as upgrading older equipment to more efficient equipment and then also the technology. So, really a mix of all those technology is a big driver. We're getting higher take rates as you mentioned. Some of the things like the harvest command has become an extremely high take rate, which automatically adjusts the combine for the conditions to optimize the combine."
3188,en,1,478,1,0.730486,positive,,positive,0.71104,"Also, our soil command is increasing take rate quite rapidly, adjusting the tillage to make a better seed bin. A lot of the precision planning components have also been a very high take rate and growing as well. And then, steering and precision have a very high take rate as well. So -- and then, the connected machines, the telematics also continues to really ramp up. So there's a lot of drivers on the technology side that we continue to see that ongoing throughout the year."

First is, if you're selling more bigger expensive equipment that has all this extra technology, shouldn't you be able to capture more margin, or is CNH capturing that? And with this telematics and connected machines, how does this going to impact your aftermarket capture rates? That impact mix for the positive over the next few years?"

3192,en,1,719,1,0.665783,positive,1,positive,0.656791,"Yes. And there are a couple of components to it too, Larry. There's the initial transactional price of it and -- which again is a driver of the purchase right now and then the ongoing revenues associated with it. So, anywhere from annual subscription fees that the farmer pays to get that data, as well as the other things that telematics can do for our parts and service business, allowing us to really help the grower and help the contractor with their uptime and just keep the machine going, preventive maintenance and then helping us to really partner with them and make them more profitable. So there are several additional revenue streams there through the precision and the parts and service side as well for us."

But it just seems like CNH is not sharing as much on this higher tech stuff, and keeping more than they're letting you guys do with selling it. I don't know, if that's right or not, but it seems like you should be capturing more margin upfront, if you guys are selling all these higher tech piece of equipment and software upgrades?"

You're talking about this kind of life cycle opportunity that you have given precision technology and so on being added to the machine. But as you ran your own analysis on this, is there a way for us to understand, how much higher is the opportunity on service and maybe parts and maintenance on these upgraded machines versus equipment that was not smart for lack of a better term? I mean, is it 10% higher opportunity over the life of the machine? Is it 20? Is it 50? How would you describe it?"

So I don't have specific numbers for you at this time in terms of will that incrementally drive our parts business 10% per se or whatever. It is difficult to break down always with that parts purchase, or service purchase, specifically due to the technology or replacement or walk in et cetera.

It's perhaps less user-friendly without the proper support from the dealer. So I think we're all trying to understand as the industry is evolving here, what your part in this ecosystem is and how you're going to be profiting and benefiting from it.

We're adding resources to handle the tech support side of it to drive the sales of it. We are optimistic again to what it'll do for our parts and service.

It's interesting that you're no longer excluding your ERP-related costs. So I'm curious as to why you've made that decision. I'm also curious as to what you anticipate these costs are going to be in fiscal 2022?"

3212,en,1,589,1,0.424181,positive,1,positive,0.431897,"Yeah. So Mig, we've been adjusting these ERP transition costs out now for the last two years. And we're close here closing in on the full implementation. So yeah, we just decided to put this in our – not just adjust these out put them into our regular operating costs here. Some of the incremental costs that we're going to be incurring this year as we get close to the go-live is going to be internal resources, to help in the training and support and those type of things. And those are the type of things that we wouldn't be adjusting out anyways or we haven't adjusted out in the past."
3213,en,1,566,1,-0.722527,negative,1,negative,-0.377973,"Last year, what you can see in our tables there that we did adjust out was a little over -- I think it was a little over $3 million or about $3 million or $0.11. We'd expect that to ramp up a little bit this next year just for the reasons I said and put more internal resources to this again for training support after go-live and going into the go-live that type of thing. So call it another $1 million, $1.5 million. So roughly around probably $4.5 million is what we're looking at for like incremental ERP costs over last year is what was in the adjusted numbers."

Maybe I missed this, but the two dealerships that you've divested, it was implied there that this is going to be margin positive with them being gone. Can you give us a sense for what these two dealerships, how much of a drag maybe they were to your fiscal 2021, or the benefit that we could get from margin from just these two being gone in 2022?"

3217,en,1,412,1,-0.275799,negative,1,negative,-0.319505,"Yes. It gets a little tricky to answer that. I mean, we allocate out SRC or our corporate expenses here to those locations. With allocating those expenses out on those stores did lose like maybe $0.5 million something like that. But they did absorb some of the corporate costs. So taking that out it wouldn't be that much. But it was overall, like I said, with SRC allocation out there it was about $0.5 million."

As somebody was pointing out earlier maybe your guidance is conservative in terms of how you're thinking about same-store sales for 2022. But look the margin in construction is still not probably where you want it to be. Can you remind us what the long-term vision is here? I mean, what are you guys working towards? I'm presuming that it's more than 0.3%. And how do we get there?"

And I think we've made some really good progress in that area. And also focus on the key products, I mean, when you look at construction you've got a huge range. You've got aggregate. You've got the really heavy mining stuff. You've got the really large roll building equipment. Then they're more of our target space."
3222,en,1,351,1,0.819507,positive,,positive,0.853312,"We're targeting the homebuilders, the commercial building, a lot of the subcontractors, your landscape people and stuff like that. So they really focus on that sweet spot where we've got some, I think, some really solid progress. We've got heritage legacy. We have backhoes mini-excavators, some of the mid-sized wheel orders to focus on that product."
3223,en,1,746,1,0.641271,positive,,positive,0.67467,"And then as I see as we get into some of our core footprint where we got some of the -- farmers use a lot of ag equipment and the ranchers. All your feed lots, all your seed and chemicals start to come in cold. So you're looking at skid steer loaders all-terrain forklifts land improvement. A lot of our growers have excavators. They're roving racks. They're putting in entire irrigation. So I think it's mini-excavators, loader backhoes, wheel orders for, like I said, for feed lots. But also the ag-related businesses some of your crop inputs companies, some of your ag processing plants are some of the big buyers of construction equipment. So they have to focus that and some of our key areas. So we've got these synergies of both our people."
3224,en,1,433,1,0.775209,positive,1,positive,0.742471,"The Upper Midwest where you've got the ag. We've got I think some decent talent. If you look at towns like Des Moines, Omaha, Minneapolis, St. Paul and some of it right in our footprint in the south and we could get some of these synergies with our people with our customers and also that ag-related business. So -- and at the same time you continue to grow this higher-margin product support business. So I say, that's our strategy."

3226,en,1,595,1,0.776888,positive,1,positive,0.712541,"Right. I mean, I appreciate that. It's just that we've been through a couple of cycles here with construction and we are yet to see actual margin momentum out of this business. And we're at the beginning of what probably is going to be a pretty good demand up cycle, right? So just as your – David, as you're thinking strategically about this portion of the business, do you see this business getting to the point where it can be as profitable or close to as profitable as your ag business, or is there something in here that will still hold it back and we should keep our expectations in check?"

So yes, I think it's definitely, if you look historically, there's been a lot of wealth created in the construction equipment distribution channel out there some creating multimillionaires. So yes, it's definitely a very viable segment."
3229,en,1,481,1,0.772552,positive,,positive,0.748897,"And like I say it is cyclical. There are some difference between the ag. But I think when we get into some of these common markets and stuff I think it works really well for us. So – but I can say, what we've done with some of our divestitures we're trying to really focus on in these markets and where we think it's a good environment to be profitable and it's in the right space. And I guess that's why we've made some of these divestitures to get ourselves in a better position."

3231,en,1,571,1,0.751289,positive,,positive,0.794082,"Right. Well, final question for me. You spent a good amount of time talking about inventory and talking about tightness in the channel. I guess, what I'm wondering here is this. If demand is better than what you're anticipating right now in agriculture, so better than up 10% to 15%, do you think you have the ability to get inventory to satisfy that demand, or are things so tight now that you would simply have to sort of say Hey look I'm going to take the order but I might not be able to deliver the machine until fiscal 2023. Can you help me understand that dynamic?"

There's a lot of growers that pre-sold crop last year and are just going to start recognizing these higher prices, as we go throughout the year some of them maybe not until harvest time and so on. But if we got into that opportunity, again we do have a pretty good supply of late-model used."
3234,en,1,332,1,0.828334,positive,,positive,0.805251,"We've got presales that are coming in throughout the year. We've got some larger customers that we roll with that generate quite a bit of nice late-model used for us. So that also is another good opportunity for us. The lease returns that I mentioned earlier, we've got quite a few of those coming back, really nice supply of those."
3235,en,1,405,1,0.660568,positive,,positive,0.866685,"The new itself could get tight. So if you got into that situation you could see a bit of a change in mix of revenue for us from – to more used but – and then we do have the opportunity to pre-sell into next year as well, which is very common with the lead times that would – and a big uptick like that could end up potentially being captured for us next fiscal year when that equipment would ship in then."

3237,en,1,440,1,0.435559,positive,1,positive,0.344147,"Okay. Just to clarify, because I think I heard you answer another question saying that, you're kind of expecting to be able to kind of catch up from an equipment availability and supply standpoint somewhere around the fourth quarter. But that's using current assumptions for growth and demand. If things are better than that then that's essentially the thing that kind of starts pushing things into fiscal 2023, right? Did I get that right?"

But we know there's increasing demand for greater technology in equipment that should boost parts and service accelerate through replacement cycle, et cetera for you guys. But what are you seeing as far as consumer desire for greater digitization of the retail and service experience and your guys' ability to buy, sell, service, do more online?

3254,en,1,342,1,0.410525,positive,,negative,-0.412239,"Okay. So, first of all on the ag, there's been a little bit of a pause on that. I think the basic fundamental's out there. I think we're on the front edge of another round of consolidation, the aging dealer principals, the sophistication of the equipment, the capital requirements out there, lack of succession alternatives, things like that."
3255,en,1,299,1,-0.609847,negative,,negative,-0.557336,"So with COVID, to get this, it's been difficult to get totally engaged.

We've got the balance sheet to do some acquisitions out there, and we're really looking at doing some larger-quality acquisitions, and we're fully engaged with that.

Of note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories."

In total fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from non-consumable categories, and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by, increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees."

3392,en,1,492,1,0.597541,positive,1,positive,0.585995,"Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it looks like you're guiding to about 60 basis points of operating margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. Why wouldn't it be more than that? Given you're comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a two-year stack basis plus you're benefiting from all these margin-enhancing initiatives like DG Fresh, Fast Track, NCI and others. And how -- within that, how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus 2019?"
3393,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
3394,en,1,399,1,0.549317,positive,1,positive,0.502785,"Yes. So I'll tackle both those questions, Michael. This is John. First of all, I'd say, we're really pleased with what we did in 2020, expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didn't give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds, the biggest headwind being the SG&A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year."
3395,en,1,340,1,0.692118,positive,,positive,0.578006,"We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables, which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall."
3396,en,1,390,1,0.874425,positive,,positive,0.899852,"Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin, again, we feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that 117 basis points for the year. And to your point initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out."
3397,en,1,695,1,0.782383,positive,,positive,0.859232,"The three biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns, higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. But we also as I mentioned are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So, as we look ahead in the near term, these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer-term, we do feel like we're well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned, the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we've talked about before within gross margin and within SG&A."
3398,en,1,666,1,0.776664,positive,,positive,0.806428,"But at the same time, it's noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10% double-digit EPS growers over the long-term, we are continuing as we called out to reinvest in the business. We mentioned $60 million to $70 million that's hitting SG&A next year. And then the other thing I'll mention is in terms of COVID expenses, we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we've captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers."

3400,en,1,573,1,0.284414,positive,1,negative,-0.275424,"Understood. That's very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And we're all just trying to figure out what's going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down 16% versus the 34.5% in March of last year, it would imply a high teens two-year stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year? Have you -- are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens two-year stack would be, kind of, a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months?"

3402,en,1,720,1,0.382608,positive,1,positive,0.439194,"Yeah. I can help you there Michael. I'll start by saying, it's bumpy, right? There's a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March, you're extrapolating over a very short period of time, which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here, we called out, yes, as you mentioned the negative 16% month-to-date from the end of February through March 16th this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year, it was not dissimilar to the 34.5% comp where we ended the period, so fairly representative. But again there's a fair bit of noise within this, so I'd be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully that helps you understand where we were at this point."

3408,en,1,616,1,0.557008,positive,1,positive,0.564285,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, I guess, first on the comps. The 10% to 12% that you mentioned in the release on a two-year stack, it actually felt like that's a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so -- yet you're still going to have stimulus at least in the first part of the year probably now and for a little while longer. And so, I guess, the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that? Any thoughts around it, why -- if the 10% to 12% in our view is doable, why couldn't the top-line end up being a little bit stronger?"
3409,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
3410,en,1,349,1,0.78327,positive,,positive,0.731441,"Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again just dialing the clock back a little bit, we've said historically that this model works really well at a 2% to 4% comp. That's the engine of the 10%-plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a two-year comp stack of 10% to 12% over two years that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that."
3411,en,1,340,1,0.848203,positive,,positive,0.869347,"And I tell you we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said, the relevance of the brand, the broadening appeal, the new customers we've brought in, the bigger baskets we're enjoying I'd say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted, the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance."
3412,en,1,666,1,0.689268,positive,,positive,0.676438,"So we feel good about the guidance that we've provided. But we did note that -- and it's based on what we know, but what we did note was that we didn't include the impact of stimulus. because it's really relatively unknown what impact it will have to what degree it might help. So that's not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there's just a lot of uncertainty when you think about; one, compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain."
3413,en,1,409,1,0.357082,positive,1,positive,0.35265,"And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times what people say and do is two different things and so it remains to be seen if that's the case. So we're cautiously optimistic. We didn't build it in. It could be an upside, but it's just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree."

If you look at the gross margins versus 2019 and John you mentioned some transportation costs, is there any reason why they shouldn't be higher than 2019?"

3418,en,1,573,1,0.769263,positive,,positive,0.632153,"I'll just say that we're really pleased with the performance we've been delivering over the last few years, growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over two points this year. But again there's a lot of unknown this year, a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned, when you look at this year that does create some deleverage. And again, we are investing in the business. Now again that investment piece is accretive, but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates and then obviously, you do have other inflationary pressures."

3425,en,1,400,1,0.529425,positive,,positive,0.529425,"And then on the double-digit two-year stack that you forecasted for this year, how much of the acceleration relative to the past two years do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains? Trying to get a sense for that two-year stack of double-digits relative to mid-to-high single digits the trailing two years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable?"

3427,en,1,445,1,0.837916,positive,,positive,0.848387,"Yes. This is Todd. Yes, I would tell you let me take the second part first. I would tell you that that comp we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is we've seen them continue to come back so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into 2021. We see them still here in 2021, which is really good to see."
3428,en,1,359,1,0.625217,positive,,positive,0.705305,"And again with all of our initiatives, Matt, that we've got put together I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I'm not going to give you exactly what you're looking for, but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here."
3429,en,1,568,1,-0.297705,negative,1,positive,0.290541,"And then what we've seen so far just to give you a little bit more color non-consumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March, it will become even more meaningful because as you recall the stock-up trip from last year with the pandemic with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable food, perishable areas really took off last year and non-consumables were a little soft quite frankly. And we're seeing the opposite quite frankly right now. So that's great to see."
3430,en,1,313,1,0.891034,positive,,positive,0.896655,But what we can also see is that our initiatives around non-consumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those non-consumables in them as well. So they're spending at a good rate there and we believe that she'll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year.

3432,en,1,361,1,0.780793,positive,,positive,0.773713,"Great. And then maybe just to follow up John on the SG&A front. Could you just help quantify what you've embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective just so we can baseline it? And then ex the strategic investments, is there any change to 2.5% to 3%? I think that's roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that?"
3433,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
3434,en,1,574,1,0.688811,positive,,positive,0.787134,"Yes. I'll tackle both of those. First in terms of the COVID spend, obviously, we're going to do what's necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That's of course going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say we've built in a considerable reduction of that assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that's what's captured in the guidance. We didn't give a specific number on that, but it is a considerable step down."
3435,en,1,515,1,0.694405,positive,1,positive,0.696487,"As you think about SG&A and the 2.5% to 3% leverage point, we've kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One we are investing in SG&A to drive overall operating margin expansion particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh as we're taking over self-distribution, NCI you spend a little bit on SG&A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin, so it's very beneficial overall. But it does throw off the math on that."
3436,en,1,586,1,0.322842,positive,1,negative,-0.268262,"And then there are some other initiatives like pOpshelf and others that are more --have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we've done is we've really stepped up the remodels and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out that's a lot to strip out that as well as the COVID expenses, yes we're still looking at that 2.5% to 3% leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. But that's really the only change to that."
3437,en,1,311,1,0.737185,positive,,positive,0.666765,But for the next few years as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores for instance and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That's really the big driver there. But overall it's accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective.

3445,en,1,418,1,-0.32581,negative,1,negative,-0.329651,"Good morning, guys. So I apologize upfront about another sales-related question. But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So, if we were to basically dollarize your comps for lack of a better term, it looks like there really wasn't much of a change in your sales run rate like from a sales per store perspective between March -- February and March."
3446,en,1,379,1,0.973407,positive,,positive,0.973407,"So, two questions; first is that a fair assumption? And then related to that assuming you maintain a pretty steady -- are you assuming that you're going to maintain a pretty steady sales per store cadence for the balance of the year, or are you expecting a deceleration in kind of sales per store during the course of the year as we hopefully enter a more normalized environment?"

3448,en,1,550,1,0.92264,positive,,positive,0.938163,"Yes, that's a good question. I'll start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year, we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we've put in place like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries."
3449,en,1,348,1,0.376891,positive,1,positive,0.577703,"So, we've assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. But as we've looked at it throughout the year, we've also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now there is concurrent with the pandemic there is a consolidation of trips and we're benefiting from that as well as again benefiting from that share of wallet."
3450,en,1,312,1,0.836342,positive,,positive,0.779817,"So, as you go through the year, we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as you're competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet.

3451,en,1,547,1,-0.744117,negative,,negative,-0.621127,"And again as we said I don't want to dissect February and March too much because again it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March and again, you're extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So, when you strip out all the noise, I would tell you that again with the guidance we provided that contemplates what we've seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is again stimulus and we just didn't put anything in for that because we just don't know what that benefit will be and to what degree."

I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar 2021? I mean obviously you saw a pretty meaningful I think deceleration in traffic in February but that's off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year.

And I know 2021 is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts, but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to 2022 on the gross margin front."

So, on the traffic side, again, February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that quite frankly we -- you saw in the release 8,500 store hours of lost time, but the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost two days, we had anywhere from 20% to 30% of our store base close for that time. So, it's a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what's happened in March. But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4."

And we're still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new non-consumable type items that we've got in our stores, she still comes to us."
3467,en,1,236,1,0.748733,positive,,positive,0.685229,"So, we believe we're seeing that repeat customer. And there's no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John?"

3469,en,1,409,1,0.825496,positive,,positive,0.760049,"Yeah. And then to the second part of the question, and I agree with you, there's just a lot of noise in 2021. I think one thing, I would point to as you look at over that two year period lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line a two year CAGR of 15% to 20% I think really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line, and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future."
3470,en,1,398,1,0.411851,positive,,positive,0.695548,"Now, I don't want to give specific guidance around 2022. It's premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4, and for the full year, as I mentioned, it's the strategic initiatives, which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we're reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin."
3471,en,1,891,1,0.610529,positive,1,negative,-0.272716,"Now the one thing that we mentioned just – 2020 a little bit was the mix, so that's why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat, which is a bit of a drag. But the thing – the other items driving that gross margin expansion we expect to continue. And so that's why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year, and would encourage people to look at that two year stack and push forward the same drivers are there that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term, not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones, but really pleased what we've seen with the shrink improvement, the supply chain efficiencies, a lot of opportunities still around private brands, penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management."
3472,en,1,600,1,0.774497,positive,,positive,0.779369,"Again, when you look at our scale and our growing scale, as a limited SKU shop it really puts us in a very favorable position, to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front, we'll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now, and as we've seen for quite a while now, we feel like we're in the best position on pricing we've been in, and don't see at least the foreseeable future the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin, while also driving traffic and sales."

Karen, I would also just – just say real quick, and then get to the next question is that, I feel as good about this business than I have the 12 almost 13 years that I've been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated, I think once we get through the noise of 2021, I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen even prior to COVID, we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there's no reason why that shouldn't continue as we can – as we go long term."

So if you look at, the overall dollars, we quantified about half of that was sales flow through. So maybe that's the way to dimensionalize that."

3484,en,1,353,1,0.584456,positive,1,positive,0.594375,"Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess, John first starting with guidance. I was curious, what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative, I was just curious, if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately?"
3485,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
3486,en,1,337,1,0.890786,positive,,positive,0.893652,"Yeah. As you look at the promotional backdrop, we think it remains rational. It's been that way for the last about a year and half, so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward, we're not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we're very well positioned on price. And Todd, do you want to add anything?"
3487,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Todd Vasos
3488,en,1,600,1,0.755883,positive,1,positive,0.671326,"Yeah, Rupesh, I would tell you from a position of strength last year, we've positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than we've been in many, many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing, we are better than we've been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated, the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame, and quite frankly has been that way for a year and half. So we feel pretty good about where we are, but always reserve the right, if we need to help our consumer out we'll do that. But right now, we don't see that in the near future."

3490,en,1,308,1,0.798927,positive,,positive,0.840401,"Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So Todd just curious on your latest thoughts on, what you're seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us, I mean, it is a fairly strong consumer out there stimulus is coming. So, I just want to get your thoughts there?"
3491,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Todd Vasos
3492,en,1,545,1,-0.553227,negative,1,negative,-0.738774,"Yeah. I would tell you the consumer – our core consumers always stretch as you know, but I have to repeat that each time, because she really is. And I would tell you that, in the last six to eight months, she's felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases, because again lack of work, or not working that full 40-hour shift to that full-time that, she was doing in many cases. So and our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point."
3493,en,1,124,1,0.966329,positive,,positive,0.96827,"In saying that, what we have also seen though is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that."
3494,en,1,422,1,0.922616,positive,,positive,0.918514,"So we're in round three and as I indicated, it's very early on in that third round. We're bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we're also bullish, when we think about the back half of the year, the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December, should also benefit our core consumer. And then, obviously, the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps."
3495,en,1,332,1,0.793692,positive,,positive,0.787936,"So there is a lot of tailwind. We just, in our guidance, didn't contemplate any of that, because again it's so -- first of all, it's so new, we just don't know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing, Rupesh, to keep in mind is that we're well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she's outspending it."
3496,en,1,425,1,0.848169,positive,,positive,0.827398,"And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said, there are other -- we're not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get more than our fair share at retail. It's just some of these other areas that are now open, whether it be dining out, whether it be travel to some degree that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money."

3504,en,1,260,1,0.70992,positive,,positive,0.694475,"Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about these new banners that you spoke of today. And especially, with pOpshelf you mentioned doing a store-within-a-store concept with signage for both pOpshelf and the Dollar General banner outside."
3505,en,1,227,1,-0.433026,negative,,negative,-0.433026,"As you think about your core customer, what gives you confidence that the customers will not feel an alienation to the core banner with this double signage outside in a store-within-a-store concept? How do you think about that?"
3506,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Todd Vasos
3507,en,1,282,1,0.626418,positive,1,positive,0.657819,"Yes, that's a great question. And I would tell you, first of all, our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the pOpshelf consumer. But in the areas that we're looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts, it is a little higher demographic than our core."
3508,en,1,338,1,0.407762,positive,1,positive,0.426798,"So just to give you some color, in these areas, the demographics are more in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range versus our true Dollar General of $35,000 to $40,000 range, somewhere in there. So it's not quite the pOpshelf where it's $75,000-plus. But I believe that the crossover, there's enough there to entice the consumer to come in."
3509,en,1,278,1,0.494,positive,,positive,0.494,"The second piece of it is that, we believe that -- and we've already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in pOpshelf and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General, without even having any signage up with pOpshelf."
3510,en,1,214,1,0.884267,positive,,positive,0.896676,"So, we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation, higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box."
3511,en,1,220,1,0.877103,positive,,positive,0.847683,"It is a test, right? So just keep that in mind. It will be 25 stores this year. But if it works and we believe it will, there could be some additional ones that we do in 2022 and many more as we continue to move forward."

3513,en,1,305,1,0.80679,positive,,positive,0.761897,"Got it. And my follow-up is around new customer retention strategy that you mentioned during your third quarter call around -- some strategy around, basically, retaining those new customers. Could you give an update on that as to what you're doing to retain new customers that you gained during this time?"

3515,en,1,434,1,0.65084,positive,1,positive,0.632728,"Yes. Thank you. Well, we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it, because we knew, because of the way we were doing it, this wasn't a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane, we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set."
3516,en,1,262,1,0.703905,positive,,positive,0.709645,"So to be able to do that, it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customer's mindset. And -- so we've been working it hard now for the better part of five months, coming on six months. And we believe that we've seen the benefit of that already."
3517,en,1,182,1,0.851933,positive,,positive,0.851933,"When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out, we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store."
3518,en,1,312,1,0.33814,positive,1,positive,0.499935,"So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. And now, even into Q1, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing that core customer -- or I'm sorry that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more, we're still seeing that customer."
3519,en,1,356,1,0.527168,positive,1,positive,0.504411,"We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that we'll continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in.

The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that it's providing for us. So to be in 16,000 stores-plus is really an accomplishment. And originally as we talked about, DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs, improving in-stocks and a broader assortment, and we've hit on all three. So, that is performing very well."
3532,en,1,393,1,0.82052,positive,,positive,0.795037,"The other thing that we're excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that we've also introduced, the reason we're able to build larger stores with more coolers, is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that."
3533,en,1,234,1,0.962606,positive,,positive,0.962606,"And so, when you think about the future and our new format prototype that we're going to be moving to in the mid-part of 2021, DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer."
3534,en,1,312,1,0.881564,positive,,positive,0.927464,"And then, as you look to the future, we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over 10,000 stores as we look ahead. So, DG Fresh again, complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing, but is going to set us up for the future in a big way."

3537,en,1,226,1,0.637577,positive,1,positive,0.608172,"And when you combine being five miles within 75% of the population and self-checkout that we've got in 1,600 stores right now, the convenience bar continues to rise. But, we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far there."

And the first priority remains investing in high-return growth opportunities, like new store growth remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then, it's still continuing to pay a competitive dividend, which we recently increased 16.7%. And then, it's buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity."
3543,en,1,283,1,0.792716,positive,,positive,0.697268,"But as we've always noted, we want to protect our current investment grade credit rating, so we keep the leverage ratio around 3.

An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

I'll begin by offering a warm thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for your commitment and thank you for always making safety your top priority."
3576,en,1,830,1,0.700678,positive,1,positive,0.72369,"And stepping back and reflecting for a moment, it's hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID. I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago, here in our March 2020 earnings call, when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild. Yet in typical Jabil fashion, our people did what they do; they dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic. They did so by looking after one another, while taking outstanding care of our customers. It's a point in time that I'll never forget; it's a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil. Their attitude and their actions continue to impress. And for sure, there is no other team I'd rather be part of. Again, much thanks to all of our employees who simply make Jabil, Jabil."
3577,en,1,915,1,0.887052,positive,,positive,0.816628,"Please turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at our 2Q results. Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected product demand, solid execution and a well-balanced contribution throughout the entire company. The team delivered core earnings per share of $1.27 on revenue of $6.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%. I'm really pleased with our financial results for the quarter. Although, what's quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '21. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around our second quarter results during his prepared remarks."
3578,en,1,638,1,0.82381,positive,,positive,0.802205,"I'd now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate. Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient; this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand. Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers. It's a proven formula that's trusted by many of the world's most remarkable brands."
3579,en,1,1114,1,0.93109,positive,,positive,0.928779,"Moving to Slide 7, I'll address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of $5 a share, an increase of 25% from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around $28.5 billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10 basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be 4.2% for the year. Lastly, we remain committed to generating a minimum of $600 million in free cash flow, a testament to how we're managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook, it's notable that our strategy is working, our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point, when we think about the how, we think about purpose; a purpose that guides us in our journey, a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors; behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world. I'm just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas."
3580,en,1,933,1,0.776046,positive,1,positive,0.811353,"As we transition to my final slide, I want to once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two years to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets; markets that largely align with secular trends. A few examples of these being 5G, personalized healthcare, electric vehicles, digital learning, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. Our team continues to develop deep domain expertise in concert with these secular tailwinds. I like the decisions we're making and what we're doing, and we do what we do while respecting the environment and safeguarding our workplace. We're committed to a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance. We encourage each and every employee here at Jabil to be their true self. We strive to make the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier, and a little bit safer each and every day."
3581,en,1,216,1,0.988812,positive,,positive,0.988812,One factor that makes good companies great is possessing a value system which allows them to solve problems over and over again; we embraced this way of thinking and welcome the challenges put forth by our customers.

3584,en,1,853,1,0.908784,positive,,positive,0.919259,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark just detailed, our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broad-based end-market strength and associated leverage, and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. We saw broad-based revenue strength across the business, most notably in mobility, cloud, healthcare, connected devices, automotive and semi-cap. Given the additional revenue, I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of 4.2%. And finally, our net interest expense came in better than expected during the quarter, due in large part to better working capital management coupled with the proactive steps we've taken over the past year to optimize our capital structure."
3585,en,1,681,1,0.556304,positive,,positive,0.697241,"Putting it all together on the next slide, net revenue for the second quarter was $6.8 billion, $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $700 million or 11%. GAAP operating income was $236 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99. Core operating income during the quarter was $285 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q2 was $33 million and core tax rate came in at approximately 23%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 154% improvement over the prior year quarter."
3586,en,1,680,1,0.783515,positive,,positive,0.767209,"Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis. The strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based as several of the end-markets we serve are becoming increasingly critical such as connected devices, healthcare, automotive and mobility. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.1%, 210 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.2 billion, also reflecting strong broad-based demand. Core margins for the segment were 3.1%, 80 basis points over the prior year."
3587,en,1,848,1,0.860995,positive,,positive,0.908693,"Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $20 million in Q2 and capital expenditures, net of customer co-investments, totaled $152 million. We exited the quarter with cash balance of $838 million. We ended Q2 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q2 with access to more than $4.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $82 million. At the end of the quarter $254 million remained outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization, and we intend to complete this authorization during the second half of FY '21 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders."
3588,en,1,909,1,0.66757,positive,1,positive,0.580495,"Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 19% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion; this is mainly due to strong end-market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.4 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion or an increase of 9% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $220 million to $270 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.89."
3589,en,1,1006,1,0.814681,positive,,positive,0.882633,"Next, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. In healthcare today, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We're in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare."
3590,en,1,586,1,0.840198,positive,,positive,0.793184,"Another end-market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today, electric vehicles account for less than 2% of total vehicles in the market. Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend."
3591,en,1,1047,1,0.943436,positive,,positive,0.94191,"Turning now to 5G; 5G will transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering, manufacturing and eco-friendly decommissioning observers [ph], all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times, security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers."
3592,en,1,700,1,0.792102,positive,,positive,0.769425,"Shifting now to packaging; we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally, within semi-cap, the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions, spanning the front-end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back-end with validation and test solutions."
3593,en,1,1101,1,0.919992,positive,,positive,0.934188,"In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results in the first half of FY '21. As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY '21 estimates for revenue, core operating income, core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $28.5 billion [ph]. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5. And importantly, despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts."

Maybe Mark, first question on the EMS side. You're guiding now to $13.4 billion that's almost a billion dollars higher than the previous guidance. But the operating margin is still guided at 3.6%. So just curious, I mean, why isn't the operating margin target for that for this year for EMS moving up a little bit more? Just if you can just talk about the puts and takes on that. Thanks."

3603,en,1,897,1,0.767872,positive,1,positive,0.754164,"Thanks, Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think you're right, we look at the overall corporate margin for the year, we think we'll be around 4.2%. And EMS will be in the range of I would guess 3.6%, 3.7%. I look at that relative to fiscal '19. If I go back that far, and I think EMS in '19, was around 3% all in. Last year, we're below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think we're doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business, some businesses that we've gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID. But most importantly, Ruplu, I think about things that Mike was talking about in his prepared remarks in terms of trends that we think are going to be around for a while. Things like 5G, electric vehicles, cloud computing, clean energy."
3604,en,1,257,1,0.608355,positive,1,positive,0.526209,"So I feel good about the year. We continue to make OpEx investments as well in the EMS segment, but I think we're on a good trajectory.

I mean, are you concerned or how concerned are you about any configuration changes that might come up in the rest of the year? Can you may be at a high level, just talk about how prepared Jabil is this year versus in prior years about handling mobility related, you know, volatility that can come up in the rest of the year?"

3614,en,1,810,1,0.68897,positive,1,positive,0.657083,"Okay, thanks. Good morning. Mark. I wanted to start with a question on operating margin and acknowledge it's been very strong so far. A two parter [ph] just on near term and long term moving forward. So first on near term, your Q3 guidance implies that total company operating margin is going to be down, maybe somewhere around mid-3% range or so and then back up to around 4% or so in Q4, based on the EPS guide if I got that correct, doesn't look like that's volume related because revenue is going to be flattish during this time. So, maybe just more color on drivers of the Q3 dip and rebound in Q4. And secondly, you mentioned longer term as you exit this year with a four handle. The trajectory that that puts you on as you think about fiscal '22 and beyond, because you said you wanted to build on that?"
3615,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Mark Mondello
3616,en,1,960,1,0.629186,positive,1,positive,0.646602,"Yes, thanks Adam. Q3 is always a little bit of a debit for us. And, as much as we take a lot of I don't know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What we've done in the last two, three years. But again, we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level, in terms of up margin. I think you're right, enterprise margins for Q3 will be around the 3.5% range. And, again, I compare that to last year, which maybe it's nonsense, because of COVID it's up substantially year-on-year. I'm going off a memory, but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal '19, we'd be up year-on-year in terms of Q3 to Q3 as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know, Q3 tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that I'm focused on more than anything is beginning of the year."
3617,en,1,868,1,0.590001,positive,1,positive,0.545706,"So we've had, we've strung together, I don't know, adding four, five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around 3.5%. That says we've really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September, we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin. 90 days ago in December, we took that up to four one now we're taking that up to four two. So I feel, I'm more focused on that trajectory than the quarter-on-quarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond '21, we'll give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September, I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that we're very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal '22. And that would be relative to the four two, that we hope to post this year."

And maybe just as a follow up for Mike, you talked about being able to plan to generate over $600 million of free cash flow this year, wondering if that's also something that you can build on like Mark's comments on operating margin as we think about a go forward basis, or are there are CapEx investments to achieve that operating margin improvement? And maybe you can just tie in your capital allocation priorities as you answer that question? Thank you."

3621,en,1,1266,1,0.594383,positive,1,positive,0.585573,"Thanks, Adam. Yes, definitely free cash flow will, I think we've said more than $600 million for this year, as we continue into FY '22. I expect that to continue to grow. Again, we've said this before CapEx is something where we've been extremely disciplined in that 2.9%, 3% range. So free cash flows next year again, we'll get guidance in September, but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid [ph] as it's done in FY '21. As relates to capital allocation Adam, we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks, we have to earn $34 million left of our authorization, we intend to complete their authorization in Q3 and Q4 or in the second half of the year. So that shows that we're extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into '22, '23. I don't want to preempt anything now. But I'm sure we'll be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the, I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages, roughly half buys into buybacks, dividends, some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic, sort of M&A as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward."

If I look at your updated guidance on the buy segments, am I correct that the 5G wireless and cloud is the one that kind of is giving you the most surprise there? And if so, are any of your segments or all of them or any of them experiencing semiconductor shortages? Are you able to procure all the components and items needed? Thank you."

3629,en,1,1308,1,0.763981,positive,,positive,0.777284,"Thanks, Jim. I assume you're talking about our eight sectors [ph]. Yes, so, I'm not quite sure we mean, in terms of surprise, in terms of the uplift, for sure. So I don't know that it's a surprise to us that we're seeing strength in 5G and cloud. Back in December, we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But we've been very bullish on the 5G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not, it's certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think that's largely both on the 5G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints, I would say that we talked about this a bit in December, let's say, nine months ago, or so. You know, there was demand drops everywhere, based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals, cut them abruptly. And then, at least our conversations with our customers, very few people anticipated the rebound that we've seen, which largely started August, September timeframe, and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of 2021. And on the supply side, again, all of that drove constraints."
3630,en,1,1105,1,0.628978,positive,1,positive,0.656271,"One good piece of information, I think to share is any type of supply constraints, whether it be around resin, whether it be around silicon, whether it be around passives, whether it be around mechanicals all that's handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q3 and Q4. So I feel if anything, maybe there's some slight upsides to what we've put out today, assuming that the supply constraints don't work and worse. And the other thing I would say is, I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale, if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning, whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive, our team's knowledge of the marketplace, the knowledge of the commodities, knowledge of technologies, and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel we're getting along and getting by quite well, all things considered on a relative basis."

You know, maybe referencing back to when you first did the J&J [ph] deal, and what you were thinking for next year? And then secondly, I just don't clear based on what you just said about constraints and potential inventory builds, Mike, you're talking about still doing $600 million in cash flow, free cash flow is the difference between prior thinking just basically higher EBIT, offset by more inventory investments or there other puts and takes. Thanks."

So if you can provide some color into how it performed during the quarter, both top line and margin and where you are on the margin journey, you know, referencing back to when you first did the J&J deal? And then secondly, I'm just trying to understand make sure I understand the that the cash flow target staying at $600 million plus, you have higher EBIT, but it sounds like higher inventory investments. Is that basically the puts and takes versus 90 days ago, or is there anything else? Thanks."

Steve Borges [ph] and his team who run that business, we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I don't even know how long ago now to 2.5 years ago, we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care, like personalized health, like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter, another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology, the investments that our healthcare teams are making, and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business, speed, last year, I think was in the neighborhood of $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion. And I would guess, as we exit this year, health care and packaging, we'll be bumping up against $5 billion. And I think we'll continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years."
3649,en,1,1119,1,0.443885,positive,1,positive,0.439389,"In terms of the $600 million of cash flow it's another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe it's a little bit confusing, because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldn't cash flow go up? We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two, three, four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team, we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as we're adding good quality business, again, attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins, as we look at '22 and '23. So if I take you back to the beginning of the year, we said we do $26.5 billion, $27 billion in revenue. Now we're bumping up against $28 billion, $28.5 billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital, the way the team's managing CapEx, and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August 31 of the year."

And I'm just wondering, Mark, if you can talk about how much of this is structural in the industry itself? And how much of it is under your control? What is that you are doing today that makes you feel sure that you're locking in higher margins in sort of medium term?"
3657,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Mark Mondello
3658,en,1,1061,1,0.703077,positive,,positive,0.652249,"I don't know that it's structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins that's always good but we're pretty inwardly focused, Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think, if we don't get that out of order, Paul, and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues; the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year, I was noticing something over the weekend, this will be along with the margin trajectory, I think this would be the first year we've ever had in the history of the company, if we execute, and that's a big capital, if but if we execute, we're going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds $1 per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion, you asked about is it structural? I think so. That's our plan and that's what will allow us to take margins up from the 4.2%, as we get into next year."
3659,en,1,1075,1,0.367964,positive,1,positive,0.357455,"And I think about everything from our balance sheet, if you take a look at, and again, now I'm coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve, net debts going down, interest expense is going down. Overall, liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very, very good overhead and overhead costs, I think about overall demand, I think about the secular trends that we've talked about, sometimes that's a really, really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets, which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then, the whole COVID thing, it's not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here, we hope to have 70%, 80% of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. It's just and then I think lastly, and we've been talking about this for 10 to 12 quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as it's ever been."
3660,en,1,286,1,0.746777,positive,,positive,0.773041,"So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again, I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around 3.5%. I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to, on a structural basis, increase margins by 100 basis points as we look forward after that 3.5% base."

3662,en,1,490,1,-0.47947,negative,,negative,-0.625485,"Well, maybe the follow up then Mark is, what is it that you're not doing? Are you able to, it sounds like you had the choice of not doing some business, because you could be satisfying your customers delighting them even but it could be bad business that you're doing ultimately, from a margin perspective. So can you talk to us a little bit about how you shaped the portfolio and what you do at the front end to prevent low margin business coming in and hurting the overall business model?"

3664,en,1,1224,1,0.705308,positive,1,positive,0.720861,"I think it starts with absolute clarity, communication to the troops internally. You know, I can tell you this, I've been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we don't communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where we're going and why we're going there and what our purpose is there's no better team, there just isn't. And so people understand that there's two things that we're focused on for the next two, three, four years, and that's continued expansion of cash flows, and continued expansion and margins. And by the way, our portfolio, we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side, but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin, but maybe the working capital is a little richer, we have some of that in our healthcare, space and other areas. But when you blend all that together, I think there's just a picture here, that we're just starting to paint. And, again, we feel pretty good for the next two to three years."
3665,en,1,453,1,-0.301287,negative,1,negative,-0.280441,"To answer your question directly. We're just going to stay away from bad business. And you know that that could mean a variety of things. But I think internally people are pretty clear on what we're going to go after. Certainly, if we can go after business where there's going to be positive trends going forward. It's goodness for everybody. But I think I think the organization is pretty clear about the type of businesses we're not going to go after."

I'm just curious to know specifically, maybe you can give some more details on what's driving that and what I'm trying to figure out is, is this demand that would have come in the future but as being pulled in now as people start to ramp 5G? Or are you seeing market share gains and actually end market growth because obviously, the market is growing? But how much of it has been driven by increased and demand overall? And then I have a follow up. Thank you."

3673,en,1,1341,1,0.717703,positive,1,positive,0.727977,"Shannon, I'd say and I don't want to be offensive by not getting into details. I would say this with a high degree of confidence. For sure, we're seeing stretch secular trends and trends that are very positive in terms of cloud and finally, what looks to be reasonable plans in terms of the 5G Wireless rollout. So that's going to be helpful. And we think that's here to stay for, not a number of months, but a number of years. And by the way, we think that's going to have all kinds of tangents tied to it as well, once the 5G rollout gets underway in terms of derivatives to other parts of our business. And then I think I complement that with saying, there's just been good acceptance of our solutions and our services in the space, both on the design side, I think Mike alluded to, he was using some fancy terms around, what we call a kind of designed to dust and repurposing older servers. And he did a nice job explaining it, but it sounds a little, I don't know, overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side, all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware, kind of front to back, I think, Shannon, the solutions we have in that space. Again, it's still what I would call early days, but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well."

I can't make sense of the US equity markets anymore, because I don't know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put $4 trillion of stimulus into the system, and there's dollars everywhere, they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters, maybe into 1Q of '22. But the nice thing is, so as we navigate '21, I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors, some of those will dissipate, some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulus-related. In certain parts of the United States right now, you go and you try to buy a truck or car, an appliance, whatever it may be; there is backlogs everywhere, and I think that's stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus, and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it, I think what's right behind that is kind of -- no kidding, no nonsense secular trends. And again, Mike talked about it, I talked about it in our prepared remarks; and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two, three, four years, so it's not like I'm sitting here going, geez, when stimulus abates [ph], when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce -- that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So, I don't know if that helps or gets at your question, but that's how I see it."

3685,en,1,433,1,0.532878,positive,1,positive,0.548007,"Yes, thank you and good morning. Mark, your commentary across end-markets extremely positive; one area that you're still guiding down year-over-year as networking and storage. Looks like you took that up a little bit from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion but still down. Could you tell us what you're seeing in that market? Is there still weakness in on-prim spend and expectations of that improving as the recovery continues post-COVID?"

3687,en,1,1383,1,0.632237,positive,1,positive,0.685948,"Yes, sure. So the network storage business was around $2.8 billion in fiscal '20. September, we took that all the way down to $2.2 billion, and again, that's a reflection of a couple of things; it's a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing, and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is; again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal '22 and '23, there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital, might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is, from the September timeframe to December timeframe, to today, we've actually been on a trajectory back up. So that's nothing more than, A) we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space; and we'll continue to serve those customers, serve them well; and as long as they'll have us, and appreciate the value we provide, we're all in. And -- so I -- again, I think about $2.8 billion in '20 to down $2.2 billion in the last -- I think December, and today we've taken it back up by $200 million roughly. And I would just look at -- I'd look at network and storage as a -- a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses, margins might be tight, cash flows are quite good, so it's a very good complement to the other seven sectors."

We are committed to returning capital to shareholders but at the same time, and I made this comment around growth; you know, if we ever get to a point where we're not growing the company, then shame on us, but we have to do so in a margin-friendly cash flow-friendly way, which is I think, what I hope this year's results will start to prove out. And as part of that the good news is, almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes, but we will continue to complement that with select M&A activity, and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition you're talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership, a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that they've developed, and we always ask ourselves the question; when we're looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment, we start with capability and competency, and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging, and this is kind of a second or third step for us, we believe that we'll be able to take that technology, and as we look towards fiscal '22, fiscal '23, give that technology -- it's due in terms of further R&D, and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet, our scale and our relationships."

The company's doing very well on margins and guiding to 4.2% for this year, despite what I would think are some temporary cost headwinds related to the supply chain environment, including the shipping cost as the most important component shortages that the whole industry is having to deal with. Can you talk about how much of a headwind the company may be seeing from some of those supply chain types of costs this year? And if we were to add that back, do you think that's more representative of the underlying margin levels that the company can hopefully build off of going forward? Or are there any other temporal factors that we should be thinking about that's influencing margins this year?"

You know, I -- geez [ph], I said earlier, we've -- we've certainly handicapped the business for Q3 and Q4, and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that -- you know, if we didn't handicap the business, maybe margins would be 4.3% for the year, I wouldn't get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier, Mark, the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management, it's wonderful. And just listening to others, either a few customers, suppliers or folks in our industry, we're navigating this thing beautifully, and it's a tough deal but the impact to us, I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again, as we sit here today, we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week, and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief, as we get into 1Q of 2022 and for sure, as we get into calendar 2022. So to frame out that timeframe, call it September, October, November timeframe; we'll start seeing relief.

The capital intensity, that is enormous, and I don't want our people focused away from what we do really, really well which is sensors, components, sub-assemblies for the entire automotive space; and thank you for the compliment on that, we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half, three years ago was -- is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV, not just with automobiles but all the transportation; and I think that -- I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification, that would suggest right in our core and the R&D dollars and the investments we've made in that area have been substantial; so I feel pretty good about how we're positioned there, and we'll see how that plays out for '22 and '23. If I had to speculate, make a little bit of a guess today; I think today we look at that the -- the H-sector [ph] chart and -- in FY '20 automotive transport was about $1.7 billion, in September we took that up to $1.9 billion. We're sitting here today saying it will be a bit over $2.2 billion.

For customer acquisition costs, as you mentioned, Lauren, we see here is competition from our online channels. So, the strategy for us is to continue to use our offline channels and the wage for the leads to be generated through offline channels continue to increase. The overall percentage is already close to 70%. So, 70% of the leads coming from our offline learning center promotions and offline activities."
3813,en,1,385,1,0.762752,positive,,positive,0.776462,"We think we'll continue to focus on offline this year. And of course, the fourth quarter number is very encouraging, but I think the full year 2021; the acquisition cost will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. But I don't think we'll use the expensive channels to -- will hopefully contain that acquisition cost level around the fourth -- the third and fourth quarter of 2020."

Most of our students acquired in 2019, who did not experience offline learning because of the pandemic went on online right away after we launched our online courses. So, the whole experiences are not that satisfactory. The retention rate came down in the third quarter."

So for the Beijing, the three instalments, the renewal rate is already close to 90% back to the level prior pandemic and then the graduation retention rates also coming back to high 60%.

I have a few questions here. The first one is about the regulation risk impact. Can you share some of your thinking about this regulation this time in this year? Well, how and how could that impact the new learning center – new learning center opening because you have 100 learning center opening plan and teacher and tuition fee collection and also maybe the capital supervision impact?"
3822,en,1,210,1,0.724344,positive,,positive,0.642897,And I think you mentioned that you expect your Beijing learning centers to reopen later this month. So that – do you already get the government communicate with government yet on this. This is a first question.
3823,en,1,560,1,0.798548,positive,,positive,0.798548,"And second one is, you’re now expanded your subject to mathematics and logic thinking. So could you share some more color on how you – how – what the strategy on this or the operations thinking on this like how this cost develop is internally. And how will acquire students and what the price for the subject? And you are targeting number one for – in the offline. So, can ask the near-term target maybe what the current revenue contribution from the subject retention in this year? And last one is, what's your franchise acquisition plan this year? Thank you."
3824,en,1,15,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,A – Lihong Wang
3825,en,1,516,1,0.77791,positive,,positive,0.775582,"Thank you, Sheng. Let me answer the first question first. In terms of regulation, we all know that during this month, particularly and started from Beijing that more regulation target, I would say the training or the -- what we call the [Foreign Language] Sheng as you mentioned there are a number of areas that government wanted to tighten the regulations and put more supervisions. The first is so-called the license to operate ex-curriculum. And for this one it really reinforced the regulation published in 2018."
3826,en,1,309,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.721721,So we checked our licensing status and feel majority of our schools already obtained licenses and approval. Only a very small number of schools is in the process to getting licensed. And maybe two to three in Beijing there are hard obstacles. For example the property is not -- cannot satisfy the requirement.
3827,en,1,476,1,-0.449057,negative,1,negative,-0.397701,"So, I would say, we don't have much issue around that area. The second area, the government wanted to put more -- maybe restrictive measures is the tuition -- prepaid tuition. However, how to really regulate this is front is still uncertain. And for RISE we already have experience in Shanghai for example that we need to put in a so-called custodian account for each school we opened. And so this is not an issue for RISE particularly with abundant cash that we have on hand."
3828,en,1,424,1,-0.461236,negative,,negative,-0.561323,"The second possibility on this front is to work with a bank or insurance firm to put in measures to make sure that if there's anything happened with the so-called providers then the parents can get the money refund. On this one, we still are waiting for the detailed implementations. Personally, I feel this is not easy to implement, so Warren will look for partners and see what is a better way to cope with the regulation."
3829,en,1,721,1,0.706409,positive,1,positive,0.678994,"The third you mentioned is, whether government encouraging the education accountant. I think for RISE we target a very young age starting at 3. And majority of our students are aged, 3 to 6 and the teaching content for RISE focuses on how to communicate, how to think logically and how to become the leader for the future. I think this teaching or educational philosophy is consistent with what government wanted to promote. And we are confident that we -- plus the mathematical logic thinking courses, we really focus on how to train the kids to be a creative thinker, to be a logic thinker rather than focusing on test prep. So hopefully on the regulation side, we will not be the one really targeted by the government."
3830,en,1,410,1,0.781433,positive,,positive,0.75351,"In terms of learning centers in Beijing, we already received requirement from a local district educational bureau to submit documentations and we have data on that. Some of the requirements associated with putting money in the custodian account and also ask a certain percentage of destination. So, we are all in the process to satisfy those requirements. However, I don't know when we will be allowed to open."
3831,en,1,259,1,0.575551,positive,,positive,0.615615,"Across the nation, we don't see stricter restrictions. And as you can see that our new centers continue to open outside Beijing both direct owned and franchisee centers. So we have the full confidence that this should not be a problem on the center expansion."
3832,en,1,565,1,0.485947,positive,1,positive,0.347973,"The second question regarding the mathematical logic thinking. In fact, we started to create STEAM courses in the middle of 2019. So this -- the cost development has been ongoing for quite some time. During the pandemic, because we have to move everything online. We made the decision to simplify the STEAM courses to focus on mathematical logic thinking. So that courses already been offered to students since June 2020. And we have tried out in our self-owned learning centers to recruit students and also higher new students recruit new students online directly."
3833,en,1,635,1,0.616847,positive,,positive,0.75194,"So we have experience on the teaching and we already have a number of times of renewal for that classes. The reason we think we wanted to target offline because first RISE has a very strong offline network. Second we have very good experience running offline centers both on the operational side and teaching side. The third is, we see the landscape -- we feel this is a sector already get embraced by parents. However, there is no clear leader in the offline market. And through the surveys we conducted, we feel very similar to English, a majority of the parents are very willing to consider offline courses offered in this category."
3834,en,1,291,1,0.860014,positive,,positive,0.850896,"As I mentioned we have a plan. So the two ways that we expand our network; one is we'll open a dedicated classroom in our existing self-owned centers. This year we already started three in Beijing, and we target to open dedicated classrooms in 30 to 40 self-owned learning centers this year."
3835,en,1,447,1,0.656039,positive,,positive,0.792687,"On the franchisee network side, we will start from our existing franchisees. In fact, the first franchise schools will be open in -- hopefully in April in Guangzhou. And this year the target is to sign on 100 franchisees partners. However, because it's offline, they need time to open stores. So for the schools, at the end of the year, hopefully, we'll see dedicated to mathematics logic franchisee learning centers to be around 20 to 30 schools."
3836,en,1,452,1,0.820931,positive,,positive,0.777598,"In terms of revenue, it is still early. So pardon me that we are not at the stage to give you the number. However, with the plan to leverage our existing student base and learning centers and franchisee partners, we feel very confident that we can roll out the mathematical logic thinking courses very quickly to be meaningful -- with meaningful scales at the end of the year.

We expect our revenue in the full year to be in the range of RMB 1,420 million to RMB 1,730 million. And for this quarter 2021 the Q1, as you'll probably know like, there's a slight COVID-19 impact in Beijing and the Shijiazhuang around the Chinese New Year, and so the revenue is around let's say, RMB 300 million because of the COVID-19. And – but the performance for this quarter will not represent the actual operating outcome and that's we have strong confidence than for the whole year guidance, we can make it. Thank you."

As I mentioned, we right now have very strong operational capability delivering OMO model, which means that in normal situations, our higher grade classes will have online during weekday. And then all the weekend classes are delivered offline."
3858,en,1,474,1,0.859463,positive,,positive,0.787083,"However, if there's any COVID-19 situation comes up, we will switch the classes online. We can do that within a couple of hours. So in the case of Shijiazhuang and Beijing, basically the next day, every classes was put online. However, the online, as you know that has shorter time, therefore the revenue recognition will be some compromise or discount. That's why for the first quarter, we still don't know when Beijing will open, therefore will impact revenue recognition."

3872,en,1,487,1,0.653238,positive,,positive,0.796204,"However, at the same time, the online students normally would also have one offline courses to complement that because the courses delivered online has a limited effect. So, going forward, we think these two formats will coexist. And even for RISE, as I mentioned during the presentation, we definitely see the demand, therefore we launched the 1:00 to 4:00 premium English small classes online, using foreign teachers. This is also a supplement to what we offer offline and through OMO."

And for K3 and S1, we actually are selling our 1:00 to 4:00 premium online English small classes as additional courses to supplement them. And this year, this is part of the strategy as well. So, we think, right now, the student base, we target, we don't see impacted by the AI courses, of course, the efficacy are entirely different."

Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time.

3903,en,1,747,1,0.817035,positive,1,positive,0.749453,"Thank you, Andy and hello to everyone on today’s call. First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we’re pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we’re prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term, and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It’s why I wouldn’t trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic, we have stayed focused on our unique advantages, and we’ve been resolute in fueling innovation, and our brand is as strong as ever."
3904,en,1,659,1,0.853623,positive,,positive,0.831517,"I am proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products, new campaigns, the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still, we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week, we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5-year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025, outlining clear goals, action plans and accountability. And for the first time, that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals."
3905,en,1,1033,1,0.860994,positive,,positive,0.88921,"Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities, from sustainability to representation, to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately, this isn’t just the right thing to do, it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value, raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense, accelerating our long-term strategy. And as I said, this continues to be a dynamic external environment, but I am proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens, COVID spikes, forced enclosed – store closures, port congestion on the West Coast and more, this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win."
3906,en,1,531,1,0.744991,positive,1,positive,0.713775,"Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers’ number one favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both men’s and women’s businesses. We’re also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China, where our strong portfolio of brands, including Jordan and Converse, is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world, the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us, driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy."
3907,en,1,916,1,0.823068,positive,,positive,0.832374,"First, NIKE’s connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon, having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbappé became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals, leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball, with Lebron’s team taking on KD’s, Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today, with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 women’s teams and 15 of the top 16 men’s teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world."
3908,en,1,572,1,0.803255,positive,,positive,0.826974,"Second, our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We’ve had tremendous success in digital, quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries, NIKE’s digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever, the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful."
3909,en,1,771,1,0.837723,positive,,positive,0.779796,"Third, we stay at the front of the pack, thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter, we announced the launch of SNKRS Live, our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3, we doubled the number of countries with live streaming, adding Japan, Germany and Italy. We’re seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 minutes I wish it were 15 years, well above the industry norms. We’re also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community, content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether it’s through the SNKRS App, our Activity apps, platforms like TikTok and more, we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital."
3910,en,1,606,1,0.919645,positive,,positive,0.901376,"And fourth, the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter, growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broad-based, led by our biggest growth opportunities: digital, international, apparel and women’s. In fact, Jordan’s women’s business was up nearly triple digits, a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee, one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever, with more than $175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward."
3911,en,1,637,1,0.881685,positive,,positive,0.923263,"As always, our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovation’s at our core, reflecting not just our foundational values, but the values we share with consumers. We don’t just innovate for the elite athlete we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners."
3912,en,1,639,1,0.830422,positive,,positive,0.894597,"This quarter, we focused on a key problem for runners, with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running, with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape, a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape’s silhouette, materials and design details are all aimed at new runners, and it’s seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport."
3913,en,1,1305,1,0.821057,positive,,positive,0.813757,"We are also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We’ve set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we’ll continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month, we launched Cosmic Unity, our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative, which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon, embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity, which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA’s best, including Anthony Davis, is NIKE’s first performance shoe made out of at least 25% recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. We are also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on, easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star, the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone, from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We’re initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights."
3914,en,1,651,1,0.865074,positive,,positive,0.88578,"This quarter, we acquired Datalogue, a data integration platform that will help us process, analyze and act on the data we enjoy, thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data, turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment, we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights, along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning, creates a capacity that no other brand has."
3915,en,1,551,1,0.921212,positive,,positive,0.93377,"Let’s quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games, we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace, including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation, as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations."
3916,en,1,573,1,0.834344,positive,,positive,0.801297,"The last thing I’d like to discuss is digital. We’re taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent, seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners, we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving, with growth of 54% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America, which had its first-ever quarter with $1 billion in digital revenue."
3917,en,1,1200,1,0.860842,positive,,positive,0.839298,"As you know, we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered, being 50% of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date, increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKE’s ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever, with an over 60% increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter, led by our SNKRS App, where we’re seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We’re seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80% versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores, member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases, enabled by robust store training programs, member-specific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active, high-value members across all of our channels."
3918,en,1,262,1,0.716693,positive,,positive,0.715985,"In the end, NIKE is staying on offense and we are focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook, led by digital, and everything we’ve seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long-term and we are not slowing down."

3920,en,1,11,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Matt Friend
3921,en,1,874,1,0.587572,positive,1,positive,0.52917,"Thank you, John and hello to everyone on the call. As we have entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges, our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future, the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. For example, in Q3, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand."
3922,en,1,990,1,0.679366,positive,1,positive,0.682941,"In North America specifically, inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks, impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA, additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and/or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we’re focused on what we can control: optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility, accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team’s unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn’t have said it any better, we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future."
3923,en,1,485,1,0.873957,positive,,positive,0.870133,"Now as I reflect on the third quarter, I want to highlight two important points. First, NIKE’s brand momentum is as strong as ever, and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full-price sales with lower markdown activity, and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season."
3924,en,1,1241,1,0.819746,positive,,positive,0.767927,"At our core, NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies, growing revenue 42% on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year, with digital demand doubling versus fiscal ‘19. NIKE Digital grew 54%, led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90% versus the prior year. Women’s drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter, including nearly 90% growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace, we are increasing NIKE’s market share across our key markets. And last, the Jordan Brand grew 15%, delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business, and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling, to our deep consumer connections, our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms, NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality, sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio."
3925,en,1,707,1,0.892685,positive,,positive,0.872109,"Second, this quarter demonstrated how a more direct, digitally enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70% year-to-date, and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds 35% of our total business. This quarter, we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal ‘22 and beyond, we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel, with digital mix increasing towards our 50% vision."
3926,en,1,996,1,0.876531,positive,,positive,0.86396,"NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live, Rise and Unite will create distinctive, authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale, while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly, they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter, where member checkout rates reached 90%, paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal ‘22."
3927,en,1,615,1,0.911945,positive,,positive,0.918214,"As I’ve said before, this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter, NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points, being fueled by a higher mix of digital, which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead."
3928,en,1,648,1,0.695787,positive,,positive,0.710216,"During Q3 in North America, we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product, marketing and service recommendations, ultimately increasing member buying frequency, basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct, member-centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most."
3929,en,1,735,1,0.0,neutral,,negative,-0.59071,"Now let’s turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 3% in Q3, declining 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 16%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year, resulting from higher full price product margins, due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds."
3930,en,1,773,1,-0.316548,negative,1,positive,0.327369,"SG&A declined 7% in the quarter, as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions, along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% compared to 3.9% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up 70% versus the prior year. As a reminder, prior year EPS included a $0.25 non-cash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America."
3931,en,1,836,1,-0.416077,negative,1,negative,-0.554253,"With that, let’s turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However, starting in late December, container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply, delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct, however, grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50% and we have seen this momentum continue into March."
3932,en,1,799,1,0.568912,positive,,positive,0.68519,"This quarter, we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand, inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Inventory in North America grew 31% versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20%. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year, we expect continued full price momentum, despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics."
3933,en,1,646,1,0.296298,positive,1,positive,0.46458,"In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 9% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe, government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures, with approximately 45% of our NIKE-owned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April, we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal ‘22."
3934,en,1,619,1,0.760274,positive,,positive,0.756157,"As of today, approximately 35% of our NIKE-owned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened, we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum, with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth year-over-year, complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE-owned and partner stores mostly closed, we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business, which grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, led by the NIKE App, which grew triple digits in the quarter, and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March."
3935,en,1,1354,1,0.809973,positive,,positive,0.809569,"With that, let’s turn to Greater China, which achieved its second consecutive $2 billion quarter and grew 42% on a currency-neutral basis, with EBIT growth of 75% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 52% versus the prior year, with more than 40% growth in digital and nearly 60% growth in NIKE-owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal, including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores, widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier, Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense, we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment, including the Dunk Low and the women’s Dunk Disrupt, which both instantly sold out. Our women’s business grew more than 60% versus the prior year and our 2 new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital, we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms, including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year, we doubled our number of high-value members. We also – while also increasing member retention. We’re excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China, including in the local consumer digital experience, new retail concepts and omni-channel integration with our owned and partner stores."
3936,en,1,728,1,0.667259,positive,,positive,0.596329,"Finally, in our APLA geography, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model, partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q3 EBIT grew 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly 70% on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan, we drove record weeks of member buying, launched our interactive live streaming on SNKRS and activated new O2O capabilities. In Mexico, we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal ‘22."
3937,en,1,572,1,0.656796,positive,,positive,0.694677,"I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history, and Q3 was no exception. Despite these continued challenges, we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the near-term operating environment with increasing clarity yet we remain focused on what’s required to win for the long term. With that in mind, we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year."
3938,en,1,658,1,0.701316,positive,1,positive,0.694074,"Specifically for Q4, in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth of roughly 75% versus the prior year. This reflects government-mandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the continued shifts we’ve seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA. Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly 35 basis point headwind on the full year."
3939,en,1,596,1,0.831208,positive,,positive,0.852201,"We expect SG&A dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards pre-pandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year. And finally, we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth, which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration."
3940,en,1,894,1,0.748667,positive,1,positive,0.731076,"Looking ahead to fiscal ‘22, as I said earlier, we are already exceeding our pre-pandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal ‘22 on our next earnings call. As a growth company, our offense is working. NIKE’s brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating, the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply, more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKE’s long-term potential has never been higher."

3952,en,1,1327,1,0.754881,positive,,positive,0.731412,"Sure. Well, as I mentioned, we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We’ve now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year, but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. I mentioned, Bob, in my prepared remarks that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And we’re seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail, which is our strategic partners, than we’re seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today, it’s down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct, and we continue to – we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations."

3970,en,1,907,1,0.745187,positive,,positive,0.742804,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions and Matt, I wanted to ask you, I think you just said that you raised the revenue growth rate for the year. Obviously, that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG&A for the year at up low singles, and now you’re saying up slightly, while you’re raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there, too. So I’m trying to put the – just at a high level, the picture together. It seems like there is either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer term, or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG&A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line?"
3971,en,1,11,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Matt Friend
3972,en,1,1175,1,0.692745,positive,1,positive,0.646804,"Sure. Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren’t going to be linear as compared to where we’ve been in prior quarters, nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels, I need to start with the core principle, which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us, we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. Now in the middle of COVID, we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly – and from a disciplined perspective, managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy, like our tech – end-to-end tech transformation, digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so we’ve continued to do that while we’ve been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we’re in."
3973,en,1,1457,1,0.456312,positive,1,positive,0.407231,"As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic, we don’t intend to just add it back in, okay? Every dollar we’re putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so we’re taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point, historically, prior to COVID, we were at about 33% of revenue in terms of our SG&A levels, and we’ve been able to manage through the last – the first three quarters of this year, closer to 29%. And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period, the reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that, demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID, we were at something like 9% or 10% of revenue, and it fell to about 7% in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don’t think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half, our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won’t get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time, but we believe that that’s the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery."
3974,en,1,850,1,0.603,positive,,positive,0.747429,"So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring, we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. We’re going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Women’s, we’re going to continue to be investing internationally, as I mentioned, against – we’re going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term, Michael, that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time."

It sounds like there is a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America, a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model, and you’ve made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the – I’m curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business, but you still do have strategic partners through – with stores through the U.S. In the past, we’ve seen you segment by House of Hoops, Track Club, the big installations at Dick’s Sporting Goods, those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when, if you’re going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business?"

3978,en,1,1838,1,0.846821,positive,,positive,0.801175,"Well, Michael, we start with the consumer, we start in every case with the consumer, and the consumer is really clear that they want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And they want a seamless, premium digital and physical experience. In fact, in many cases, they don’t see a difference between digital and physical, whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store, whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence, both ours and our partners. And the way we’ll go forward is we are driving, starting with our own digital and our own stores, the seamless premium experience that’s centered on the member, where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are, whether they are in our stores or our partner stores. And so we’ll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience, a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And so as we segment, it’s – we’re leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again, I think you’ll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of – a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience."

Is there anything that you’re looking or that you can learn from what you’re seeing there for the rest of the world as we all open up?

I’m on my, I guess, 14 month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands and frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior – to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising – these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it’s quite powerful. And we’re probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example I’ll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they are getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not – they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers, brand-wise, but also that when we talk about the consistent premium, seamless experience, online to offline, that deliver consumers, we’re furthest along. We’re furthest along in China, and I give that team huge credit, and we’re rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions."

And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter, and it continues to have significant impact, not only on localizing product but also – localizing product, but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. And then Erinn, maybe one other indication vis-à-vis China being ahead of other places, as the world has opened up, sport is returning. And so just the energy that we’re seeing with sport returning, we’re seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market, and it gives us a lot of optimism as we’re looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America, Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America, what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans, and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we’ve been seeing year-to-date as we are shifting, creating the marketplace shifts and continuing to lead with NIKE Direct and our strategic partners."

On – Omar, on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what’s possible, we’re just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really – has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that’s all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you’re the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our – who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that’s even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants."
3995,en,1,1375,1,0.837361,positive,,positive,0.815678,"And so I’d say we’re into our data journey, but there is so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it. With respect to women’s, the women’s business is having a great momentum. It was the – I think eighth straight quarter where women’s growth out indexed overall growth. And that’s across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, marketplace retail, grew to high double digits, and we’re gaining share in women’s, both on footwear and apparel. And while we’re seeing success in women’s to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we’ve described with a real dedicated and focused women’s team, means that we can increase our investment. So we’ve doubled our investment in women’s innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier, this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it’s just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women’s business."

And we just – it would be hard, Omar, to size the opportunity because the women’s market is so large. And we see the opportunity relative to where our business is penetrated today. And so while we continue to take share, those definitions are within the refinement of the way people define the market from an athletic footwear and athletic apparel in this. But what we’re also seeing is athletic taking share of the broader women’s marketplace. And so those are going to be fuel for growth for us as we continue to invest behind this exciting opportunity."

I think they are very linked. Jamie, it’s – I had to say we’re just scratching the surface. I mean, so yes, Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate, translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you’re beginning to see whether it’s improved and personalized search results, whether you’re seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it’s anticipating timing of when you’re due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it’s what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don’t want people, they don’t want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, and two, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that’s one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we’re going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said, scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is – it’s true in the technology industry. It’s also true, I think, in our industry, and so we’ll have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt, do you want to comment, add to that?"

We think that, as I’ve said for several quarters in a row, and Andy said before me, that the financial value of data and technology are significant for us. And we’re already starting to see some of it, Jamie, in our current performance, but the opportunity in front of us is significant. It’s being right more of the time. And where you’ll see it drive financial value through our P&L is making better pricing and merchandising decisions, where we place our inventory, how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in, and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking – is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise, as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end, there is going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think you’ll also see productivity in SG&A over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion. And so we’re investing heavily towards all of those opportunities."

The science, the science of what we are doing, it’s been done, it’s doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. It’s the creativity of our apparel designers, of our footwear designers. It’s the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesn’t displace art. It’s both. It’s data and technology help enhance it and supplement it.

I'll start today's call by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter, provide detail of what we're seeing in the broader U.S. hospital market, as well as discuss four upcoming value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to greatly enhance our business. I'll then turn the call over to Andrew, who will provide a review of our financial performance. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions."
4041,en,1,406,1,0.919341,positive,,positive,0.908131,"As a result of COVID-19, 2020 was a tumultuous year for everyone. However, as I reflect on the last 12 months, I am pleased to say that despite these challenges our team exhibited impressive resilience, which allowed us to advance our strategy and establish a foundation for Pure-Vu in the market. It's important to remind everyone that we are in the early stages of tapping into the opportunity before us."
4042,en,1,264,1,0.402598,positive,1,positive,0.392063,"In terms of market size, with more than 50 million procedures per year, colonoscopy is one of the single largest procedures in all of Med Tech. The unmet need associated with poor bowel prep is universally recognized, both from a clinical and economic perspective."
4043,en,1,304,1,0.599754,positive,1,positive,0.600019,"The thesis which motivated me to join Motus as its CEO two and a half years ago has not changed. Our Pure-Vu system has clear first mover advantage, meaning we believe we currently have no direct competition and we continue to protect our core technologies through a growing portfolio of granted patents."
4044,en,1,392,1,-0.626989,negative,1,negative,-0.570973,"The task at hand is now focused on establishing our entry position in this market and changing longstanding behaviors, both of which are challenging tasks that require focus, patience and deliberate execution. We're asking physicians and their staff to think differently about patient flow, with the goal of eliminating archaic and unnecessary delayed hospitalizations due to poor bowel prep."
4045,en,1,408,1,0.91509,positive,,positive,0.919324,"This shift in mindset requires an enhanced commitment to improving patient care and a focus towards fixing the unprofitable economics for the hospital under the current standard of care. Moreover addressing unmet needs and solving these clinical challenges requires physicians, nurses and support staff to adopt a new technology and learn to utilize it effectively in cases they encounter on a regular basis."
4046,en,1,542,1,0.776584,positive,1,positive,0.806585,"My experience tells me that changing behaviors doesn't happen overnight, it requires tenacity, telling the story each and every day and being highly targeted in our approach to influencing one physician at a time. While this process may take longer than we'd like, it doesn't change what we're playing for here, establishing Pure-Vu as a new standard of care in the large global colonoscopy market. I am confident that our shareholders, our customers and their patients will greatly benefit as we execute toward our goal of long term success."
4047,en,1,239,1,0.802529,positive,,positive,0.797589,I'd like to highlight the decisive and disciplined approach we have taken in our business since COVID-19 began one year ago. We acted with urgency in March and April 2020 cutting our quarterly cash burn by about 50% as the year progressed.
4048,en,1,485,1,0.900999,positive,,positive,0.897932,"We streamlined our areas of focus and our internal projects, continuing only those projects that we believe would enhance our business and help build medium and long term shareholder value. We strengthened our base of shareholders and our balance sheet in 2020 and early 2021, bringing in more than $20 million of additional equity capital. And finally, we continue to build strong customer relationships and gained evaluations at more than two dozen targeted hospitals across the U.S."
4049,en,1,451,1,0.688201,positive,,positive,0.81615,"Despite current market related headwinds, which are mainly attributed to COVID-19, we are in the strongest financial position since Motus GI was established and are well situated to come out of the other side of this pandemic. We believe our sales and marketing teams’ nimble approach to remain engaged with keys positions has been very effective, particularly when considering the unique environment with lockdowns and social distancing requirements."
4050,en,1,350,1,0.934717,positive,,positive,0.955483,"In the third quarter we saw a nice rebound in our business, primarily driven by an uptick in procedure volume and having on-site access to most of our hospitals. While that trend continued into early Q4, the resurgence of COVID-19 in specific geographies, particularly California and Texas created a slowdown in our momentum in November and December."
4051,en,1,206,1,-0.328084,negative,,negative,-0.328084,"With that said, I'm pleased that from a revenue perspective, despite the uptick in COVID-19 related issues in Q4, we sold more disposable sleeves than in Q3 and conducted roughly as many Pure-Vu procedures."
4052,en,1,705,1,0.598294,positive,1,positive,0.504533,"In Q4 we also successfully negotiated two new 12 month committed contracts at prominent medical centers, the University of Texas and NYU, which are both in effect for 2021. In both instances the customer made a commitment to minimum quarterly purchases for our Pure-Vu sleeves and for doing so, we are allowing the early adopters what we are calling centers of excellence to utilize our capital equipment at no additional cost, while these minimums are met or exceeded. We believe deploying this razor blade model works well in instances where capital funding is currently unavailable, as it permit the customer to expand use of the Pure-Vu system, while providing us with more predictable sleeve volumes."
4053,en,1,527,1,-0.326527,negative,,negative,-0.370915,"Given the current capital environment, we expect to complete additional agreements like these with early adopter hospitals in the first half of the year. You may also recall that University of Texas and NYU are two locations that have implemented a protocol that identifies clear clinical circumstances where the Pure-Vu system should be utilized, which is also resulting in more consistent usage patterns. Replicating similar patient identification protocols in additional Pure-Vu site, is a key focus for our commercial team."
4054,en,1,407,1,-0.345057,negative,,negative,-0.4719,"In the fourth quarter we also expanded our business by initiating product evaluations at new accounts, most notably the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and Mass General Hospital in Boston. While we may not see the current environment begin to normalize immediately, we believe as hospital access returns and GI procedures rebound to pre-pandemic levels, we are poised to drive an acceleration of Pure-Vu utilization."
4055,en,1,482,1,0.554757,positive,1,positive,0.301895,"Due to the pandemic, we've yet to benefit from having all of our hospitals fully up and running at any one time over the past year. As part of our fiscal discipline, we are currently fielding a small customer facing team. This team is doing a great job driving the result that I summarized, and as we see a more favorable environment emerge, we will look to thoughtfully invest in expanding our commercial organization with the goal of driving faster utilization and revenue growth."
4056,en,1,302,1,0.823568,positive,,positive,0.815441,"I want to switch gears to upcoming catalysts for the business. We have identified four value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to meaningfully enhance and accelerate our business in 2021 and beyond. They are reimbursement, product innovation, clinical data and strategic partnerships."
4057,en,1,389,1,0.591642,positive,,positive,0.666762,"Let me start with reimbursement. In the back half of 2020, we began to develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at positioning Pure-Vu for reimbursement coverage in both the in-patient and the out-patient settings. While there are many pathways to achieve both public and private coverage, we are initially focused on CMS programs designed to provide payment for new and unique technologies."
4058,en,1,469,1,0.587932,positive,1,positive,0.634548,"In the fourth quarter we submitted an application to CMS for a new technology add-on payment, sometimes referred to NTAP. This program could provide reimbursement for Pure-Vu during in-patient colonoscopy. As part of this submission, we also applied for an ICD-10 code. As you may have seen in a recent press release, on March 9 we participated in CMS's Coordination Meeting where I am pleased to share that they recommended Pure-Vu to be considered for an ICD-10 code."
4059,en,1,270,1,-0.256263,negative,1,positive,0.382941,"CMS is now conducting an open comment period and then the final decision will be made through a subsequent clearing process. If a code is awarded and substantively NTAP coverage, we believe adoption and utilization of Pure-Vu in the in-patient market can be accelerated."
4060,en,1,295,1,0.470528,positive,,positive,0.470528,We also submitted an application for CMS's transitional pass-through payment. This program could provide reimbursement for traditional outpatient procedures. We believe high medical need patience that can't successfully complete their pre-procedural bowl prep would benefit greatly from Pure-Vu.
4061,en,1,311,1,0.883977,positive,,positive,0.861931,"Securing pass-through coverage for our system could be a significant catalyst for our business, as it would provide economic incentives for physicians to use Pure-Vu on the roughly 5 million high medical need procedures each year in the U.S. It would also mark our first entry into the large out-patient market."
4062,en,1,355,1,0.912725,positive,,positive,0.920611,"Next, I'd like to discuss new product innovation. I am pleased to report that our product development efforts to launch our first Pure-Vu system for use in Upper GI endoscopy is on track and we expect to submit a 510-K application to the FDA by early Q3. This would potentially position us with an approved and available product on the market by early Q4."
4063,en,1,537,1,0.459604,positive,,negative,-0.369874,"We view this as a significant opportunity and believe our technology can potentially address a serious unmet need in the market as it relates to visualization and the treatment of Upper GI bleeding, which has an estimated mortality rate of approximately 10%. There are roughly 400,000 Upper GI procedures in the U.S. annually and we continue to receive significant inbound interest from GI physicians who are eager for a solution that allows them to clear adherent blood and clots from their field of view during this critical procedure."
4064,en,1,589,1,0.76204,positive,,positive,0.772067,"Next, let's discuss clinical data generation. I'm excited to announce today that we recently began enrollment in a study with the Cleveland Clinic, which will evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of using the Pure-Vu system in patients with emergent lower GI bleeding that are treated in the ICU or the rapid inpatient endoscopy suite. This study is designed to enroll at least 20 patients to undergo minimal bowel prep in order to provide patients a much faster diagnosis as compared to the current period of 24 to 36 hours or more, typically required to complete a full bowl prep."
4065,en,1,280,1,-0.823891,negative,,negative,-0.90988,"The outcome we receive from this study could begin to challenge the current standard of care for emergent Lower GI bleed patients who are facing urgent need for diagnosis and treatment, but are currently delayed. We expect to have this study fully enrolled before the end of 2021."
4066,en,1,579,1,0.842738,positive,,positive,0.811276,"And lastly, I want to talk about strategic partnerships. As it relates to our strategic options, we've spent time evaluating a number of potential pathways during the back half of 2020 and into 2021. Our objectives in considering any potential partnership would be aimed at opportunities that could accelerate our commercial efforts and enhance our technology development. Any partnership would also need to unlock clear shareholder value. As we continue to grow awareness and uptake of the Pure-Vu system, we will consider which options best fit our criteria and are actionable."
4067,en,1,103,1,0.703914,positive,,positive,0.860878,I will now ask Andrew to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Andrew.

4069,en,1,189,1,0.999319,positive,,positive,0.821905,"Thank you, Tim, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We reported revenue for the fourth quarter 2020 of approximately $36,000 primarily from the sales of Pure-Vu single-use sleeves."
4070,en,1,331,1,0.74311,positive,,positive,0.803132,"As Tim discussed, our small commercial organization has been focused on single use sleeve sales with early adopter hospitals that are starting to implement Pure-Vu patient protocol. Growth in the fourth quarter was impacted by the surge in COVID-19 cases, and the effect on new technology utilization in the in-patient environment."
4071,en,1,337,1,0.844364,positive,,positive,0.867173,"Over the course of 2021, we expect to grow our number of new system placement and work with hospital value analysis committee to finalize commercial contract at our active sites. We anticipate new and reorders of Pure-Vu sleeves to increase during 2021 and to pursue capital equipment purchases, leases or rentals with targeted accounts."
4072,en,1,235,1,-0.946643,negative,,negative,-0.946643,"For the three months ended December 31, 2020 we recorded a net loss of approximately $4.4 million or a net loss per diluted share of $0.12 compared to $5.9 million or a net loss per diluted share of $0.21 for the same period last year."
4073,en,1,210,1,0.484431,positive,,positive,0.484431,"During the fourth quarter, net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was $2.8 million as compared to $5.6 million for the same period of 2019, a reduction of 50% year-over-year."
4074,en,1,426,1,-0.935175,negative,,negative,-0.944482,"For the year-ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net loss of approximately $19.3 million or a net loss per diluted share of $0.60, compared to $23.1 million or a net loss per diluted share of $0.92 for the same period last year. Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $17.1 million as compared to $20.4 million for the same period of 2019."
4075,en,1,262,1,-0.540391,negative,,negative,-0.540391,"As reflected in these comparisons of net loss and cash spend activity for 2020 as compared to 2019, the results of our cost cutting measures which we initially put in place at the end of the first quarter have contributed to a significantly extended cash runway."
4076,en,1,366,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"At December 31, 2020 we reported $20.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. This included the $8 million from our 2019 term along with Silicon Valley Bank. In January 2021 we further strengthened our cash position through the execution of a warrant exchange agreement with an existing institutional investors, which raised net proceeds of approximately $11 million."
4077,en,1,300,1,0.992298,positive,,positive,0.992298,"We believe that with this bolstered balance sheet we are poised to execute on our upcoming value creation drivers laid out for 2021, to ensure compliance with our Silicon Valley Bank liquidity covenant with the first quarter of next year and meet our overall anticipated cash needs further into 2022."
4078,en,1,55,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."

4080,en,1,403,1,0.917724,positive,,positive,0.912278,"Thank you, Andrew and let me summarize the key takeaways from today's call. We are pursuing a global market opportunity for our Pure-Vu Technology and believe we currently have no direct competition. While this leaves us with the challenges of being a first mover, and changing physician behavior, we continue to make steady progress in creating market awareness and adding new hospitals and physicians."
4081,en,1,270,1,0.76489,positive,,positive,0.76489,"As COVID-19 hospitalizations decline, we believe we will be operating in a more normalized environment, which will improve procedure access for our sales team and enable more opportunities to drive utilization, which will lead to increased demand for the Pure-Vu system."
4082,en,1,373,1,0.971017,positive,,positive,0.968877,"Finally, we are excited about the four value creation drivers I discussed in my earlier remarks, including reimbursement, product innovation, clinical data and strategic partnerships. Each of these catalyst offer important opportunities for us to enhance our portfolio, broaden our addressable market and unlock value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders."

4086,en,1,133,1,0.834282,positive,1,positive,0.484017,Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
4087,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Drew Stafford
4088,en,1,463,1,0.840113,positive,,positive,0.987061,"Hi guys This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking the questions. I just want to start on the sleeve minimum agreement. You know maybe you could share a little bit more detail on how those are structured. You know how many sleeves do you expect those two centers to order and – or I guess how many do they have to order to reach those requirement. And then, you know how should we be thinking about that from, maybe a revenue or quarterly cadence perspective."
4089,en,1,9,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Tim Moran
4090,en,1,619,1,0.77852,positive,,positive,0.927907,"Yeah Drew, thanks for your question, thanks for joining today. So, first of all we're really excited to be able to ink these first initial committed agreements and as I mentioned, you know in my prepared remarks the capital environment very difficult, right, and at the end of the day our conviction is all around driving this procedure, getting physicians trained and getting them comfortable using the device and really improving patient care. So this is a way to get the product in, when they don't have the capital budget, but also gives us a commitment back pretty much more predictable volumes at least initially."
4091,en,1,503,1,0.624537,positive,,positive,0.624537,"While we're not going to give out specific, you know contractual details that we have with these customers, what I can tell you generally is we've talked before about you know first year utilization, we feel is typically going to be in the seven to ten procedures a month and these agreements are written to fully cover that and we expect them actually to grow much larger than that, because in most of these situations we have just a small number of the physicians who are actually doing the procedure."
4092,en,1,442,1,0.823257,positive,,positive,0.795438,"So hopefully that gives you a little bit of feel. You can kind of model that out, but that's the way they're structure today. And you know what we’d likely expect over time is that their capital budgets free up. I would think that most of these customers would end up then you know moving to either an outright purchase of the capital or you know lease agreement. But right now this is a great way to get them up and running with the product."
4093,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Drew Stafford
4094,en,1,540,1,0.431897,positive,1,positive,0.472766,"Okay, that that's [inaudible] and congrats on a couple of new product evaluations. Can you just remind us of how you know some of those processes are structured; I guess especially during COVID here. I mean what’s the requirement from training, what's the requirement from you know as far as having a sales person on the ground or anything like that. And then you know how long does it typically take with some of those account. I mean obviously we’ve talked about NYU in the past, before you start seeing meaningful utilization of Pure-Vu."
4095,en,1,9,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Tim Moran
4096,en,1,394,1,0.907695,positive,,positive,0.904774,"Yeah, you know it's been an interesting year, right, that's an understatement. So there is probably not a one size fits all answer in terms of the approach that each of these sites have asked us to kind of work within, as it relates to you know the impact of COVID on their staff and you know protocols and things like that. But typically, the structure that we believe optimizes our successes."
4097,en,1,380,1,0.646268,positive,,positive,0.646268,"You know if we can be there on-site and do initial training for the entire staff that will be associated with the product, as well as of course the physicians, you know and have kind of a kick off meeting if you will and then everyone's on the same page as it relates to what the technology does, what the benefit is. We make sure that we coordinate with the nursing floors right."
4098,en,1,297,1,0.350823,positive,,negative,-0.366169,"So if you got these patients that are up on the floor, waiting to have a colonoscopy done, they fully understand they are educated that now there's a solution down in GI that allowed them to do the procedure despite the patient being ready. So there is a lot of coordination that needs to be done."
4099,en,1,466,1,0.592042,positive,,positive,0.582545,"So in an ideal situation, we are there on-site, initially doing all of that organizational work if you will. And that has continued in several sites. As a matter of fact our evaluation in Boston that we just did here at the end of the year and into the first quarter, we were able to be on-site despite what was happening with COVID. Their protocols allowed for that, so we can follow that very approach and we had a rep and you know clinical training folks on site."
4100,en,1,585,1,0.631792,positive,1,positive,0.512459,"But in some of the other accountant and it's been a little bit of an elongated process throughout this year, we've not been able to be there. So we had to use remote tools and we talked about this before in the past, but we – you know we really digitized all of our materials, so now we're able to do things very effectively over the phone, via Zoom, you know there’s chapter narrated video that our staff has in front of them, so they can see exactly how the system set up and you know it's worked, it's worked out well. It just takes a little bit longer to try to manage it that way."
4101,en,1,374,1,0.510253,positive,1,positive,0.543179,"So the sales process, you know I would say has been taking probably upwards of you know six months plus given some of those hurdles, and in the back end the value analysis committees have been on and off meeting; it's been kind of stop and go. So I would say this is a very unusual last 12 months as it relates to the typical time that it would take to get these deals done."

4103,en,1,311,1,0.910598,positive,,positive,0.909155,"Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Just last one from me, the Upper GI indication. Maybe if you could just layout the value prop there? How similar or different is that to your current Pure-Vu market and then how should we think about that indication as far as impact your business and maybe 2022 maybe. Thank you."
4104,en,1,9,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Tim Moran
4105,en,1,325,1,0.993231,positive,,positive,0.994787,"Yeah, we’re really excited about this, and as I mentioned earlier, the team, our internal team has done a terrific job from an R&D and engineering perspective to continue to hit all of our milestones on the project. So we're on track with getting ready for submission to the FDA; we’ll have a product on the market this year."
4106,en,1,466,1,-0.932922,negative,,negative,-0.724698,"The way we're positioning this, not dissimilar to the Lower GI but obviously this is utilized for, bleeding, typically for bleeding in the Upper GI tract, and what we've heard really time and time again from our customers, very important influential customers they're doing these types of procedures on a daily basis, is that the struggle with blood and adherent blood clots that can form in the stomach and the duodenum and you know visualization becomes a problem."
4107,en,1,508,1,0.821304,positive,,positive,0.81272,"So it parallels the Lower GI’s. At the end of the day it's all about visualization, so you can see what you need to then treat.

You know Q3 was definitely a marked point where we saw a procedure volume come back to – you know I think in Q3 I talked about – you know call it 80% to 85% of pre-pandemic levels, kind of was the feel we had from speaking to our customers and you know that really for the most part continued into Q4 and you know I think that's what – you know if we look at Q1, it feels about the same.

What I mean by that is we can go in you know without a lot of trouble and be there and be in procedures, but the others have a lot of protocols in place that make it very, very difficult to be there and to get into different units and we still have certain types that we can't get in at all.

You know obviously we have another update today that they are now also you know signed to a committed volume agreement. The physicians that we work with there are terrific and have really embraced Pure-Vu, so I would say generally speaking it's going very well. And yes, it's going to take time to get to that full penetration point, but I think we're seeing – even if you look in this past quarter, we're seeing consistent reordering, we're seeing them gain a significant degree of independence."

So I think we'll see them as a very important customer for us moving forward."
4157,en,1,626,1,0.730718,positive,,positive,0.730718,"The other thing that’s unique if you will about NYU and I think we've talked about this a little bit is, the way they are structured from a physician's perspective is they have a director of in-patient services, GI Hospital if you will that is on site, on a consistent basis, right. So other facilities will have physicians that are on rotation and if it's a large GI group they might have you know physicians that you know are there doing in-patient rotation once a month or even a longer space between, whereas at NYU you have key physicians that are there each week and their full objective is to work on these in-patients."

Yes, so we definitely don't want to you know start to break it out to that level of detail, but I would say that a large portion of the early revenues that we're seeing here are coming from existing repeat orders.

So we had an account that you know switched and got the approval right at the end of the quarter and placed their first paid purchase, but that's obviously a small majority of the revenue that we're seeing right now."

We talk about some of the regulatory, you know the updated CE mark which is obviously important. We have done, I would say a high level exploration and diligence into Europe and into Asia as it relates to the opportunity for Pure-Vu and we’ve had inbound request from several different entities, interested in either selling or you know having access to Pure-Vu in their market, so we're evaluating those."

4248,en,1,406,1,0.594362,positive,,positive,0.614161,"But I think generally what we're seeing it as – strategically if you think about the NTAP, it would be an accelerator right to adoption. Because if you had some additional reimbursement on the Pure-Vu sleeve in the hospital environment, I think it would allow us to work through the value analysis committee, financial analysis much easier, you know because it's reducing obviously the overall cost burden."

I mean you mentioned the REDUCE study, which was going to be an open label registry, which we did back when we did our cost cutting last year. We did put that study in the back burner, and so right now we're focused on the Cleveland Clinic study that we talked about earlier, and those patients in the ICU."
4256,en,1,625,1,-0.656223,negative,,negative,-0.646641,"And then we are initiating a small study also in Europe and we’re going to see some of the key thought leaders there and that study is really focused on patients that have – it’s called a difficulty in prepping in the outpatient scenario and are typically coming back almost on a yearly basis, because they never got a good example. The physician that are examining them constantly just to make sure that whatever calls they missed on the prior procedure hopefully as they get larger, they will catch them before they become cancerous problems. So we will be initiating that study coming up in the next quarter or so as well."
4257,en,1,402,1,0.438155,positive,1,positive,0.582167,"So again, it'll be an interesting population, because that will also feed into some of the issues in the out-patient in the U.S. for these patient that are on a reduced surveillance interval, because they don't get a good preparation and there's concern of an inevitable cancer. So it’s a nice way for us to get some early data on that, as well as see some of the key thought leaders in Europe as well."

So we are remaining very focused on targets that have the highest potential to close. The most quickly and also kind of play a strategic role in the overall foundation setting that we are doing and I would say that’s the mode that we are in here as you know.

And as we as we look at 2021, we will also think about where we’ll expand the commercial organization in targeted geographies that we believe the ROI will be there, and that will allow it to accelerate, bringing on additional sites as well.

Reduction in net debt by $368 million compared with March of 2019. 1 priority was to maintain the safety of our employees and our customers during this pandemic. Continue to invest in our business. Again, we won innovation awards in print and digital packaging business. The customer-first model, the One Kodak model, this approach is clearly paying off for us. Materially fixed our balance sheet and financial foundation. We've been talking about that for a couple of years. Let's fix the foundation. Let's get hold of our debt. Let's find a path forward.

This control weakness did not result in the misstatement of any current or prior period financial statements. The company has remediated these control deficiencies as of December 31, 2020. Documentation and supervisory review controls around master data were strengthened, and an audit trail of stock-based compensation award additions and modifications performed by the service provider is now being maintained.

4351,en,1,450,1,0.361292,positive,1,negative,-0.31193,"Okay. Good afternoon, and let's turn to Page 4 of our presentation. So that this gives you a summary of our 2020 results. Revenue -- now, 2020 is a year plagued by COVID-19 and also the more significant is oil price drop that affects Husky Oil in a material way. And so this -- all these result has been taken into account of all this problem, and you will see that revenue, the total group dropped 8% and EBITDA dropped 13% and EBIT should drop 24%."
4352,en,1,115,1,-0.327796,negative,,negative,-0.299937,"And our earnings, minus 27%. And net earning per share at $7.56, minus 27% and correspondingly, [EPS] is minus 27%."
4353,en,1,548,1,0.32034,positive,1,positive,0.462269,"But however, because of -- we have -- the operation has been operated very tight and then we have some mega transaction come through, and then the debt ratio has dropped from 25% last year to 22%. So that we can see that this is a very excellent result because what happened at the oil front is so difficult, and the figure come through negative against us. It is so bad, but thanks to the VHA deal that we merged with TPG and thanks for the tower deal. And then we actually generate enough profit to overcome the mega losses incurred by Husky Oil."
4354,en,1,419,1,0.805594,positive,1,positive,0.449971,"And also during this year, we also fixed Husky which we will go into more detail by merging with Cenovus as the end result is a much better animal. And if you look at the -- today, when we merged with -- we were about $3, and then now Cenovus is over $10. And then if you go back to what we own in Husky, the [equipment] is about $8.50. So the result of the merger gives us a lot of hope and then we are [Indiscernible]"
4355,en,1,522,1,0.26458,positive,1,positive,0.258467,"If you go to Page 5, okay, give you the EBITDA because Husky Oil order country and percentage changes. If you see that instead of 1 circle, we now have 2 circles. One is the outer one is the actual [auditors] because Husky suddenly become negative. So that every other thing become bigger. And then the inner one -- the outer one is the actual one then the inner one is the were set right count and if you look at the graph, the chart on the right-hand side you saw that -- you saw the waterfall of how the EBITDA dropped."
4356,en,1,86,1,-0.30096,negative,,negative,-0.30096,So we go from 2019 underlying EBITDA and then the part basically dropped $2.5 billion.
4357,en,1,401,1,0.609323,positive,1,positive,0.577019,"Actually, it's mostly came from last year as first half and the second half is structured much less, and it went to the fourth quarter. Actually, it is quite a good performance. And the same thing is on the retail and then the retail is also suffered by the first half when the whole business dropped 50%. But then the second half was doing quite good. Actually, second half was better than last year."
4358,en,1,113,1,-0.745909,negative,,negative,-0.601248,"This is why. So the retail -- so as a whole year, it only dropped $1.8 billion. It's mostly come from first half."
4359,en,1,188,1,-0.466945,negative,,negative,-0.603116,And then the interest structure doesn't really affect the -- by the COVID-19 so it's doing -- it shows a green color. And Husky is the big casualty and which we will describe to you later.
4360,en,1,681,1,0.602349,positive,1,positive,0.583813,"And then the telephone group is basically -- although it showed the HKD 3.3 billion negative is actually is doing quite good. Actually, if you look at the underlying performance, it's similar to last year. So what happened is that this -- there was a nonrecurring item or onetime item happened last year, which is a $1 billion happen in Italy when we shift some compensation from some vendor and then about $1.2 billion in -- from the 3 U.K., where we got some compensation -- some benefit from the VAT. And then there was $1 billion from the corporate side, where there some adjustment came through. Actually from the operations [Indiscernible] you will see later is quite stable."
4361,en,1,363,1,0.587191,positive,1,positive,0.576717,"And the same thing happened to Asia, and then it is quite a stable operation and now. So on the head office front, I would -- basically the interest, I will let Frank talk more to it, okay? So this year, you will see that most of the -- majority of the income come from Europe and Hong Kong become more enough because of the Husky Oil doesn't contribute anything."
4362,en,1,74,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"So the next page, Page 6. Frank, on the cash flow side. Can you take over?"
4363,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Frank Sixt
4364,en,1,594,1,0.530906,positive,1,positive,0.479976,"The first sort of easy snapshot of what the cash flow profile of the group was like. So operating cash flow is just a very quick proxy. It's EBITDA from our subsidiaries plus distributions from our associates less CapEx and investments. And so obviously, on that measure, we had a meaningful decline from 2019, right? And you see that in the bars, basically, the result for this year at $39.8 billion is the -- what you get by subtracting $69.6 billion -- sorry, $29.7 billion from $69.6 billion on the columns on the right. And the distribution of that obviously speaks pretty well for itself."
4365,en,1,649,1,0.55302,positive,1,positive,0.478897,"Interestingly, though, this rough measure tells a lot less of the story this year. So if we go very quickly to the next slide, the -- there's really no important number on Slide 7. There's really no important message just to convey here, except that, essentially, everybody is living within their means. And in fact, everybody is living within CapEx and investment envelopes that are less than depreciation except, right, in the telecoms group and in HAT, where we are still in a meaningful investment phase. But obviously, the message is even on the operating free cash flow measure, right, we're very well covered in terms of our spending profile."
4366,en,1,416,1,0.458078,positive,,positive,0.820753,"The next page, Page 8, is actually quite a little bit more interesting this year because it looks at the whole free cash flow picture. And when you do that, you obviously have to take into account of what's happening to interest expenses and financing costs. You have to take account of what's happening in taxes. And you have to take account of what's happening in working capital. So it's a slightly complex chart."
4367,en,1,209,1,0.837744,positive,,positive,0.837744,"But to simplify it, if you go to the right-hand side, right, last year's free cash flow, underlying free cash flow after tax, after working capital movements, after financing cost, et cetera was $21.7 billion."
4368,en,1,418,1,0.3285,positive,1,positive,0.373784,"Now we've just gone through the reduction in EBITDA that we suffered, right, during the year of $10.9 billion, but we recovered significantly more than that, right, in terms of the, believe it or not, overall level of dividends that we received from our associates excluding Husky Energy, of course. But interest and financing costs and taxes paid were down very significantly. So in the aggregate, by HKD 6.1 billion."
4369,en,1,383,1,0.813112,positive,,positive,0.892704,"And working capital was managed very, very tightly all around from the group. I have to, in particular, single out the retail division, right, for their excellent job in managing working capital over the course of the year. So the swing from year-to-year is $9 billion. So the free cash flow underlying profile for 2020 is $27.9 billion, right, which is fully $6 billion-plus better."
4370,en,1,92,1,0.967648,positive,,positive,0.967648,"And obviously, I think a very encouraging picture in terms of the group's financial profile."
4371,en,1,372,1,0.602861,positive,1,positive,0.581288,"If we go to the next page, right? This is this is Page 9. The group's financial profile, not surprisingly, after everything that I've just said, right, is still very strong. Net debt, as we said, has reduced, has reduced substantially in absolute dollars and has continued actually to -- we've been continuing to reduce gross debt right in the first 2 months of this year."
4372,en,1,313,1,-0.28451,negative,1,positive,0.468464,"Our net debt ratio is at 22.2%. One of the things that works against us there is the movement in sterling and euros, right, over year-on-year, which increases net debt. And as a result, negatively affects the ratio. So you could argue that on a like-for-like basis that the ratio is a little bit better than that."
4373,en,1,169,1,0.941475,positive,,positive,0.877793,Our ratings stayed stable. Our weighted average maturity at 4.7 years is very manageable. We are still further down in terms of the average cost of debt capital at 1.7%.
4374,en,1,301,1,0.394104,positive,1,positive,0.333254,"We're now, after swaps, 31% in floating rates and 69% in fixed rates. That's again less floating than last year. We were 33% last year and 67% fixed. So we've been taking some advantage of moving out along the curve a bit, right, as we medium- longer-term rates, obviously, have been at historic lows."
4375,en,1,312,1,-0.337311,negative,1,negative,-0.343867,"I don't really have anything to say in terms of our debt maturity profile, except, as I mentioned, we reduced gross debt already in Q1 led by EUR 1.6 billion, roughly USD 2 billion. And CKI, of course, will report that they redeemed the perpetual of $1.2 billion right, in full, right, in February, I believe so."
4376,en,1,112,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.664485,I think that's all I have to say about the overall financial profile. And the next section is ports. So Canning?
4377,en,1,11,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Canning Fok
4378,en,1,255,1,0.495861,positive,1,positive,0.450171,Okay. Yes. The ports this year is a difficult year in the first half because of the China shutdown and then towards the middle of the year is the European shutdown. But then it really recovered well towards the end of the year. So that is the whole story.
4379,en,1,165,1,0.829758,positive,,positive,0.699468,"So that we still -- our asset is USD 11 billion and then 283 berths and 52 ports in 26 countries. And last year, we handled 83.7 million TEU, which is 3% below 2019."
4380,en,1,431,1,-0.416001,negative,1,positive,0.323822,"And then the EBITDA is $10 billion -- almost $11 billion and 19% of 2019. And if you look at, basically, if you will look at the waterfall chart from 2019 to 2020, you will see that actually, if you look at the first red is the main line and so basically it's all come from because in the first half we reduced Shanghai by 20%, so that the reduction mainly comes from the reductions of interest. It's not really from the operation."
4381,en,1,445,1,0.736555,positive,,positive,0.708861,"And then if you saw a bigger figure, $1.3 billion from Asia, Australia and all those. One of the major big is about $600 million and then come from the close of the [Dan] mine and then we provide, if you take the opportunity to provide some of the middle -- small Middle East port. And so that there is about $600 million. And then another $200 million from -- if you compare to last year, demand because we finished the concession in September."
4382,en,1,450,1,-0.36935,negative,1,negative,-0.415127,"So that if you take that away, the other is a small drop. So that actually it was better in the second half already. And then the corporate is at 400 -- almost $500 million, it's basically the dividend from OOCL, which we had last year, we don't have this year. So the ports this year have a difficult time, but they hold, they fought pretty well. And then about the September -- August, September onwards, actually, the throughput start coming back."
4383,en,1,69,1,0.866344,positive,,positive,0.866344,And then we still see a strong throughput growth until now this year.
4384,en,1,389,1,0.934799,positive,,positive,0.828837,"If you go to Page 11 somebody move the page in the screen. And so that shows you the monthly throughput. And if you look at that, the trust is all -- the green is about 2019. And you can see that all for the main trust Mainland, Europe and Asia, Australia, if you show -- it shows that in Asia and then after June, they are all doing quite well. And then in Mainland, it is the same thing."
4385,en,1,326,1,0.846545,positive,,positive,0.85419,"In Europe, actually, it is getting better and better in the summer. And then it's getting better in the last 2 months and the same as in the other Asian and Australian ports. So that the story is that -- is coming back, the stories. And then we see strong performance in January and February and also March up to today, right?"
4386,en,1,181,1,0.717376,positive,,positive,0.650008,"Page 12, let's go to the famous retail. I think we got Dominic here. He is not only a head office [Director], but he also is the CEO of Watson. So I will invite him to talk Page 12."

4388,en,1,194,1,0.988452,positive,,positive,0.890301,"Okay. Well, thank you, Canning. And I'm sure all of you will be interested and anxious to know what the retail division have -- was doing last year and also into the first 2 months of this year."
4389,en,1,312,1,0.604542,positive,,positive,0.545529,"But before commenting on the slides that follow, I would like to pass on the following messages so that to put things into the right perspective. 2020 was a testing year for all retailers in the world and A.S. Watson has proven to be resilient versus competition, with total sales dropping only 5.7% versus 2019."
4390,en,1,192,1,0.88229,positive,,positive,0.952542,"The first half of the year was very challenging with massive store closures, especially in China. But then we have a very robust recovery in the second half, both in terms of sales and profit."
4391,en,1,714,1,0.67806,positive,,positive,0.745978,"To illustrate, EBITDA in the second half increased significantly by 111% when compared to the first half. And like what Canning said, 12% increase over the same period second half of 2019. This was helped by large -- by the large loyalty member base and an acceleration in our digital transformation. At the same time, the O+O strategy, i.e., offline plus online, has enabled us to significantly increase our digital sales by leveraging our physical store network.
