Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Yu Huali of UBS. Please ask your question.

Yu Huali

Hi, this is Yu Huali from UBS. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask questions. I actually have two questions. The first one is we can see that Jupai's bottom line improved and turned profitable in the fourth quarter of 2020. May I ask what the factors contribute to the performance of Jupai's in the first quarter?

And my second question is can you give us more color on the development prospects of Jupai and the whole industry in 2021?

Jianda Ni

[Foreign Language]

Harry He

Thanks for your question. In the fourth quarter, we saw further recovery in China's overall economy, benefiting from the highly effective COVID-19 control measures and resumption of production and business. China's GDP for the first time exceeded RMB 100 trillion in 2020 with an overall annual growth of 2.3%, and an increase of 6.5% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis.

However, on a global scale, there are still uncertainties about the economic recovery due to the pandemic situation thus, high net worth individuals have remained cautious in their investment activity. For the fourth quarter, Jupai's aggregate value of wealth management product distributed decreased compared to the third quarter.

Jianda Ni

Jupai's implementation of cost control matters has yielded strong results. At the end of the fourth quarter, the total staff count at Jupai was reduced to around 580 from 2,500 at the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, we continue to enhance our tenant training strategy to increased average less management product value of distributed per adviser. In our sales network, we reduced the scale of our sales network to 31 offices covering 30 cities from 72 offices covering 46 cities at the beginning of 2018.

Our operating costs and expenses were down by 45.1% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. We were pleased to see that we have turned profitable this quarter with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB 1.99 million compared to a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB 30.15 million in the same period last year and a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB 2.97 million in the third quarter. Also, net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders in 2020 was also significantly narrower compared to the same period of last year.

In response to the change in market demand, Jupai continued to upgrade our product selection in 2020, leveraging our advantages in-sourcing products and experience in the wealth management industry. Secondary market products as a proportion of the equity value of wealth management products distributed increased to 18% in 2020 from 3% in 2019.

COVID-19 has brought long-term changes to the overall economy and the wealth management industry in 2020. Jupai has been proactive in responding to the challenges grow by pandemic and changing market demands. First, we implanted our asset transparent system strategy and continue to carry out a series of transparent inspections where we invite qualified investors from our real estate partners to jointly visit potential and invested projects in order to let investors further understand the projects through their objective observation and in-depth communication with Jupai's advisers throughout the project selection process.

Secondly, we held more than 100 live stream shows and off-line activities in 2020, which many excellent industry analysts joined us to discuss the long-term trends of the industry and attract market dynamics throughout the year. In addition, we continue to develop our technology platform to support financial product innovation, process reengineering and service offerings. We also launched paperless treating and contactless processes to improve efficiency and included mutual fund sales and services into our adviser work scope. In 2020, with the gradual recovery of the domestic and overseas market, we will strengthen our equipment and career development system to attract more talent in the wealth and asset management industry.

We are confident that Jupai's aggregate value of wealth management product distributed will increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

Okay. Thank you, Yu Huali. I will answer the second question. The global and Chinese economic outlook in 2021 is expected to continue to improve with the approval and the promotion of COVID-19 vaccines.
