29,en,1,411,1,-0.804459,negative,,negative,-0.66726,"[Foreign Language] As we review 2020, we faced two major challenges. First, on the user front, although, the pandemic in the first half of the year brought us large scale users to consume pandemic-related needs and hot trends, it had a negative impact on the content generation of entertainment vertical and certain other areas such as, tourism and sports, which resulted in less user engagement in this sector."

However, with a well-controlled pandemic situation and the recovery of the ad demand, Weibo's social marketing value proposition earned wider recognition among brand customers, leveraging our unique marketing offerings such as hot trends, celebrity and KOL marketing, as well as brand price performance solution.

On the product front, starting from Q4 last year, we further enhanced Weibo's differentiated competitiveness in hot trend and social attributes. Coupled with efficient channel strategies, we stabilized our user scale and further drove user engagement. Concurrently we also beefed up our investment in the video sector to strengthen users' mind set of using Weibo for video consumption so as to enhance our competitiveness in user acquisition."
34,en,1,690,1,0.781999,positive,,positive,0.779435,"On the channel front, in Q4, we optimized channel strategy for new and recalled users combined with hot trend and topic products.

As a result, the effective time spend per user on a post really recommendation feed increased over 30% and the effect of video views posted each recommendation increased over 10%, compared with Q3."

That has not fully recovered from the pandemic. And meanwhile, the pandemic has further driven ad budget shift from offline to online. We saw top brand customers and also those emerging brands embracing Internet platforms as their major campaign arena."

102,en,1,247,1,0.751947,positive,,positive,0.751947,"[Foreign Language] And also, you can see that, we have been doing some kind of things, right now, because rather than paying attention to MAU, now we pay more attention to the total consumption as well as the frequency of the consumption specific."
103,en,1,308,1,0.888894,positive,,positive,0.86218,"So, we can interpret that into the following kind of parameters, for example, DAU, and also some kind of frequency of the consumption, and also the total scale of the consumption.

106,en,1,224,1,0.663515,positive,,positive,0.677909,"So actually in 2021, in Q1, and also later this year, we are going to further emphasize on these two particular points. So that is to say, first of all, emphasizing on the consumptions related to the relationship-based feed."

So first of all, in 2020 Q4, we have been seeing a very good recovery of our KA ad customer, especially we returned to the triple-digit growth. And also, we although had a year-on-year decrease on SME in Q4, but still that particular decrease rate has been reduced. And also, further in 2021, we're going to really see a kind of a very good growth on the brand customers, especially at the FMCG and also automotives, as well as the luxury as well.

And also, talking about the other, traffic diverting related SMEs, without a very strong demand on branding, actually in 2020, we were talking about those O2O or e-commerce businesses. We had a little bit -- another ideal performance in 2020, but still in 2021, we are going to see a further intense competition in the area that I mentioned."

So, based on the social nature of Weibo, so we are going to really focus continuously on the kind of the strategy of the brand plus performance and also the content and also IP-based marketing strategies. So based on this particular content and IP-based marketing, as well as the strategy of brand plus performance, we have very good advantage in gaining the budget from the top-notch customers."

We do see that those customers from OTV actually had a very high requirement already kind of a content, and also the IP as well as the famous KOLs in this area. So based on the unique advantage of Weibo in terms of the IP and KOLs, and celebrities, we are very much positive to actually have the advantage of those OTV converted or transferred budgets and gaining that."

So we are going to see a kind of a triple-digit growth on OCPX as well. And also, the gaming as well as the educations as two verticals are increasing dramatically and also, because of our upgraded algorithm in this particular area. And also, talking about those particular customers, they do have the requirement, not only to gain traffic, but also they would like to do some kind of a brand promotion work.

Randomized in a 2:1 ratio, subjects in the active treatment arm will receive our Cryogen-cooled Monopolar Radiofrequency or CMRF treatment, while subjects in the control arm will receive an energy less or inner sham treatment, and again I want to highlight that the sham treatment administered in the control group for the study is a clinically inert or a true sham treatment."

It feels like there's some upside that this had on the utilization in the revenues. Could you call that out as far as geographies that you're seeing recently and obviously we don't expect any guidance, but it feels like at the moment ‘21 could be guided into ‘20 on the top line, at least from how we are looking at it?"

You know 2020 was obviously difficult, particularly in the United States where the Asia Pacific region recovered far more quickly in 2020 and actually contributed quite strongly to the 2020 results. But here at the beginning, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and 2021, I think it's – we are certain the market is improving, we're certainly seeing clinics that had to close down in 2020, re-open up, order tips, start to treat patients, see and improve patient flow. So we're optimistic that we're on the up-tick here and that should translate into a better year for us from a financial perspective."

We’ve worked hard as you know over the last 18 months or so to sort of reduce the cash burn and start to level set the financial statements and improve just operational efficiency. And so we're going to continue to improve that as we go into 2021 and while we’ll see an uptick in 2021 on the R&D line due to the trial being mostly conducted this year, you know these are tremendously expensive trials and so it won't be significant."

It's always a ramp up when you begin and we began – we announced enrollment on January ’21, so it's been a little less than two months here. And then it tends to accelerate as you get all the sites up and screening and treating patients and dealing with the flow through of the various advertising campaigns that are going on locally around each of our clinic sites. And so you know right now we feel like we're on track to hit our enrollment target of the end of the second quarter or you know very early in July."

We knew we were going to face certain challenges coming into the execution of the trial from enrollment and follow-up perspective in this environment, but I think we learned a lot in 2020 having run the feasibility study and you know try to incorporate those learning’s into this very important study for us and I think we're on track and I expect we'll get you know right up to or at or very near to the 30 site at the end of the day."

235,en,1,248,1,0.790596,positive,,positive,0.876687,Okay. That’s defiantly helpful. And then just looking at some of these secondary endpoints and it looks like you've kind of altered them or at least a couple few on them since the original trial design came out before you boosted the patient count.
236,en,1,321,1,0.489268,positive,,positive,0.50255,"Can you maybe talk about some of these secondary end points and you know why you add some, or simple ones that are chosen. I mean it seems like there are few that maybe could help us kind of get the patient guidance on when they could expect the results, or was that a consideration. What went into some of these changes?"

238,en,1,407,1,0.971769,positive,,positive,0.971769,"Yeah, I think the most important change is really the addition of the three month time point and that was really done for precisely the reason you just highlighted, which is you know if as we expect sort of to get to a positive outcome from this trial, it will be important from there as we achieve an FDA clearance and begin to be able to finally market on-label in the United States and elsewhere for SUI."
239,en,1,937,1,0.823442,positive,,positive,0.823442,"That you know physicians have a sense for the on-set of improvement in symptoms or leakage and by adding the three month end-point it really gives a nice time history of improvement, because we can look back at voiding episodes, we can look at mean change from baseline on the Pad Weight Test in addition to responder rates, and really get a sense of the time sequence of outcome and that can be communicated to patients once we're on a label from the physician in terms of setting expectations. Because as you know, ours is a tissue mechanism of action that based on our history in the many clinical trials we've run and the sort of vast commercial experience we have today, we know that it takes 30 to 90 days for the tissues to remodel and for women to start seeing clinical improvement in their symptoms. And so that's the main change to – is really adding the three month time point to the pad Weight Tests and to the voiding diary."

241,en,1,313,1,0.345831,positive,1,positive,0.266205,"Got it. That makes a lot of sense and then, obviously SUI is an embracement conditions. So it makes sense that people are suffering from it or are kind of reluctant to discuss and that's why you get that kind of broad spectrum of estimates in terms of you know what's the number of women in the U.S. that have it."
242,en,1,333,1,-0.492989,negative,1,negative,-0.338343,"But I did notice, it sounds like you're looking more at 25 million to 30 million based upon some of the prepared remarks, where you said in the press release, whereas like we caught you previously talking more or less kind of the 11 million range. Is that maybe including a little bit more of a mixed UI or why the higher figure now."

244,en,1,453,1,0.573693,positive,,positive,0.9554,"Yeah so, it’s a great question and thanks for asking it, because I think it's important to clarify that when we talk about you know 25 million to 30 million women in the U.S. with you know with stress incontinence, its was some form of stress incontinence and as you know there's pure stress incontinence, there is pure urge incontinence and then there is this enormous population of patients who have a little bit of both, which they refer to as mixed."
245,en,1,679,1,0.558293,positive,,positive,0.339045,"And so when we talk about 25 million to 30 million women in the United States have some form of stress urinary incontinence, it's including pure SUI and most of the mix patience. But as you drill down on that and really what we're focused on, you know with stress in particular is making sure we're identifying patients who have predominant SUI, and so when we talk about 10 million or 11 million 12 million of those patients who would be candidates for as of the procedure, we're really honing in on those patients who are predominantly SUI and there are a variety of clinical mechanisms to differentiate whether a patient has more stress incontinence or more urge incontinence."

Appreciate the comprehensive update and thanks for taking my questions, and great to have Dr. O'Day and Andy be part of the discussion. So maybe just piggybacking on the previous question on the upcoming 1181 clinical data at AACR, would you also have more updated cutoff relative to February 9? Could you just clarify that? And maybe Dr. O'Day if you could comment on why MSS colorectal indication kind of makes the first to pursue as you think about fast [ph] to market?

At AACR, yes, we will have a more mature data than what we've previously disclosed, and this will include more information on duration as well as potential new responses in the program too.

Well, as Jenny said, I'm new to the company in recent months, but I have had the unique opportunity to be involved with 1181 over the course of the last several years both in learning about its exciting clinical drug design as well as pre-clinical data and then obviously being involved as the principal investigator in the 1181 Phase 1 trial."

We have a bispecific that is a first of its kind we believe and it's designed really to address an entirely new area. So we will not be disclosing that anytime soon, but we'll certainly keep you informed as the data continue to progress both preclinically and then clinically and that may drive our decision on disclosures."

So as you know, Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in our initiative to advance a sustainable supply of QS-21. We've done so we're in the process of doing so, but we've already generated early data and demonstrated the bio-comparability of this new supply compared to the previous clinic version, which is now in the approved Shingrix vaccine as you know."
402,en,1,844,1,0.581505,positive,1,positive,0.548403,"So the development is straightforward. It's preclinical comparability. And then the clinical program will be very abbreviated to bring this product into market with a number of vaccine products underway. And particularly, at this time when we see the criticality of effective vaccines, we know that historical vaccines no longer cut it. Flu vaccines at 30% efficacy just won't do it. So we need to improve our ability to take antigens allow for mass global production of those and this is where QS-21 is really critical at antigen sparing allowing a fewer number or lower amount of antigens to actually be quite effective. As you see with Shingrix, it's over 90%, up to 97% effective in adults and gets better with age. These are the kinds of findings that we're going to need across the board as we deal with these mutating viruses repeatedly."

Understood. Then, last for Garo, as you think about the cash accretive transactions, just can you just high level talk to the framework that you guys are kind of evaluating internally. When you think about prosecuting these opportunities across the board more advanced late-stage versus earlier stage programs?

But what's been more impressive is the continuing subscriber, the subscriber growth for OTC Link ECN.

I wonder if you are able to or there is an estimate of how important retail investors are within that. Obviously, you’ve seen a big increase in terms of the market data size, but just wondering on the trading size, how much the high trading volume levels would you say are arising from the retail market?"

I mean people pay OTC with low price securities. A lot of the retail speculation has actually been on NYSE and NASDAQ Securities, GameStop, AMC, Hertz. So, and this isn't to say that we don't have those same forces going through. And the debate within the industry is really not is this, a peak volume, but has the floor gone up."

We exceeded the high end of our guidance with sales volumes of 9,307 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 86% was oil. Contributing to our production outperformance was a continuation of our highly successful workover and reactivation efforts. We also performed 8 CTRs in the fourth quarter, including 4 in the Northwest Shelf and 4 in the Central Basin Platform. Our ongoing CTR program converts wells from electrical submersible pumps to rod pumps, which reduces future overall operating costs and lessens costly workovers."
585,en,1,426,1,0.665849,positive,,positive,0.701046,"During the fourth quarter, we generated $25 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed $13 million of free cash flow during the period, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow. We utilized our free cash flow and the cash on hand to pay down $47 million of bank debt and ended the period with $41 million of liquidity, increasing our liquidity by more than 25% than what we had at the end of the third quarter."
586,en,1,575,1,0.657808,positive,,positive,0.849688,"Finally, with the funds from equity rays and supported by rising oil price environment, in early December, we initiated a targeted Northwest Shelf drilling program that focuses on our highest rate of return inventory. All 4 of the wells drilled in our winter drilling campaign have been completed and are on production. As we noted in our release, the first well we drilled, the Badger 709 B 6XH, is currently producing over 400 barrels of oil a day and is still cleaning up. We are pleased to see initial production results from these 4 wells have exceeded our expectations."
587,en,1,591,1,0.509604,positive,1,positive,0.399687,"Now let's take a look at the full year 2020. Our average sales were 8,790 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 87% was oil. We performed 29 CTRs, including 17 in the Northwest Shelf and 12 in the Central Basin Platform. Our continuing targeted CTR workover and reactivation programs, combined with our ongoing cost optimization initiatives, contributed to a lifting cost of $10.52 per BOE, an 8% decrease year-over-year. We generated $86 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed to $40 million of free cash flow, which we used to help pay down $75 million of bank debt during 2020."

Our SEC proved reserves were comprised of 87% crude oil and 13% natural gas, with 57.5% of total proved reserves classified as proved developed, and the remaining 42.5% as proved undeveloped. Our reserve life ratio based on year-end 2020 SEC proved reserves and 2020 production was 23.8 years. The PV10 of our year-end 2020 SEC proved reserves, taken from our standard measure of future cash flows, was $556 million, which was down 40% from the $923 million at the end of 2019 primarily due to lower prices."

Included in the loss were pretax items including $129.6 million for a ceiling test impairment due to the reduction in the value of reserves from lower oil and gas pricing, $15.2 million for unrealized losses on hedges as a result of the changes in oil price and $2.8 million for share-based compensation expense. Without these items, after the effect of income taxes on the adjusted items and adjusting for a valuation allowance of $50.6 million, our net income would have been approximately $6.5 million or a $0.07 gain per diluted share."

For the full year 2020, we had $69.7 million in cash flow from operations, $30 million in capital expenditures, which resulted in free cash flow of $39.7 million."

Our received prices were $40.48 per barrel of oil, $2.21 per Mcf of gas, for an average of $36.61 per BOE.

I'm happy to answer any questions on them during our Q&A. As Paul discussed, we were pleased to generate free cash flow once again during the fourth quarter of 2020, our fifth consecutive quarterly period. During 2020, we paid down $75 million on our credit facility, and we will continue to use much of our free cash flow for that purpose. Paul will discuss in more detail in his closing comments, but with the recently initiated targeted drilling program, we are in a stronger position to pay down debt even faster given the high rates of return afforded by our deep inventory of drilling prospects. As we previously announced, in December, we completed our fall bank redetermination, and our borrowing base was set at $350 million. As of December 31, we had $313 million drawn on our credit facility, which resulted in liquidity of $40.6 million, including $37 million available on the revolver and $3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents."

For full year 2021, we anticipate an average -- sorry, yes, 2021, we anticipate an average lifting cost of $0.10 to $10.50 per BOE, which reflects a decrease compared to full year 2020 lifting cost of $10.52 per BOE."
601,en,1,693,1,0.802768,positive,,positive,0.6617,"Turning to our 2021 capital investment program, we plan to drill 6 to 8 wells and complete 8 to 10 wells during the full year 2021. We are targeting total capital spending of $44 million to $48 million, with all expenditures to be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations. In addition to company-directed drilling and completion activities, our capital spending outlook includes targeted well reactivations, workovers, infrastructure upgrades and continuing our successful CTR program in the Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform areas. Also included is anticipated spending for leasing, contractual drilling obligations and non-operated drilling, completion and capital workovers."
602,en,1,324,1,0.663337,positive,,positive,0.664957,Our 2021 capital program has been designed to sustain or minimally grow our production and reserve levels and have returns sufficient to generate free cash flow to further reduce debt. Our existing commodity hedges were implemented when prices were lower last year to ensure the necessary cash flow to adhere to these plans.
603,en,1,42,1,0.564202,positive,,positive,0.564202,"So with that, I will turn it back to Paul."

605,en,1,431,1,0.537916,positive,1,positive,0.48953,"Thank you, Randy. On our third quarter earnings call, I discussed in detail Ring's competitive strengths as well as the challenges we face and how we were addressing them. A lot has changed over the past 4 months since we last spoke, mostly for the better. However, I want to talk a little about the severe winter storm that affected most of the energy industry here in Texas and, more specifically, how it affected our production."
606,en,1,608,1,0.441368,positive,1,positive,0.550294,"We incurred a considerable hit on our production in February, down more than 60% for the majority of the storm. We had an unusual amount of downtime that took us 2 weeks or more to restore. Our first quarter production will be less than what we were originally predicting as a result of this downtime. However, we have restored our production, and with the performance of our new wells and the continued improvements we are seeing in our other initiatives, we will still generate free cash flow for a sixth straight quarter, we will still pay down debt, and we are not going to change our full year guidance."
607,en,1,1131,1,0.978519,positive,,positive,0.981372,"The next thing I want to discuss is our new strategic vision. We are committed to key principles that we are squarely focused on: ensuring health, safety and environmental excellence and a strong commitment to our employees and the communities in which we work and operate; continuing to generate free cash flow to improve and build a sustainable financial foundation; pursuing rigorous capital discipline focused on our highest-returning opportunities; improving margins and driving value by continuously targeting additional operating cost reductions and capital efficiencies; and strengthening our balance sheet by steadily paying down debt, divesting of noncore assets and becoming a peer leader in debt-to-EBITDA metrics. These key principles will continue to guide us, and we are committed to them by pursuing the following 5 strategic objectives: first, we will attract and retain the best people, knowing that our future success can only be achieved through our employees. Second, we will pursue operational excellence with a sense of urgency. This objective is a foundation that will define our culture and future success."
608,en,1,389,1,0.795608,positive,,positive,0.774585,"So what does that mean exactly? We will execute our operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, apply advanced technologies and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash cost on a per-barrel basis. We plan to deliver low-cost, consistent and efficient execution of our drilling campaigns, our work programs and other operations, all with a high sense of urgency."
609,en,1,399,1,0.841695,positive,,positive,0.835645,"An example of this is our highly successful CTR program, which reduces operating expenses and lessens costly workovers. The impact from this program can be seen in the decrease in our lifting cost per BOE from $11.42 in 2019 to $10.52 in 2020. Our confidence in this aspect of our culture is reflected in our forecast of continuing to lower cost this year from anywhere from $0.10 to $10.50 per BOE."
610,en,1,487,1,0.67377,positive,,positive,0.667588,"And yet another example is we relocated our headquarters to the Woodlands and downsized the Midland office, closed our Andrews field office, are in the process of closing the Tulsa office, reducing leasing expenses and resulting in meaningful annual cost savings. But the biggest impact of this change is not the cost savings, it is the consolidation of the executive and management teams, allowing for improved communication, strategizing, execution and continuing to build our culture."
611,en,1,880,1,0.760635,positive,,positive,0.8662,"Moving on to the third strategic objective is to prioritize our work programs and invest in only the highest risk-adjusted rate of return projects in our inventory. This will allow us to profitably grow our production and reserve levels and generate the excess free cash flow we need to pay down debt. We have already discussed our CTR program and our Northwest Shelf drilling program, but both of these demonstrate our commitment to generate as much free cash flow as we can from every dollar we spend. As you know, we drilled 4 Northwest Shelf San Andres horizontal oil wells in December and January, including 3 1.5-mile horizontal wells and 1 1-mile horizontal well. All wells are now completed and producing at various stages of cleanup. Early production results have been at or above expectations, and we look forward to completing the full program over the next few months."
612,en,1,676,1,0.819083,positive,,positive,0.904797,"Moving on to the fourth strategic objective, which is the -- which is to focus on generating free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt. We intend to do this through the use of excess cash from operations and potentially through the proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. Last month, we announced our plan to launch a sales process to divest of our Delaware Basin assets during the second quarter of this year, we are still committed to that plan. Remaining focused and disciplined in this regard will lead to meaningful returns for our shareholders and also provides additional financial flexibility to manage commodity price cycles in the future."
613,en,1,490,1,0.904621,positive,,positive,0.814798,"And moving on to our fifth and final strategic objective is to pursue strategic acquisitions that maintain or reduce our breakeven cost. We will focus on accretive acquisitions, mergers and dispositions that not only improve our breakeven cost but improve our margins, lower our operating costs and are accretive on a cash flow basis. Our financial strategies associated with these efforts will focus on delivering competitive risk- and debt-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders."
614,en,1,803,1,0.852564,positive,,positive,0.872136,"I want to end my prepared comments by, once again, thanking the entire team of Ring employees for their continued hard work and dedication. The past year has clearly been the most challenging in modern times on a global scale, and especially for the oil and gas industry. While I have only been in the company for a little over 5 months, I have quickly come to appreciate the collective determination and dedication of Ring's employees at all levels of the organization. As important, I appreciate the way they have so quickly embraced our new strategic vision, which is evident in our operational and financial results as a direct result of their actions. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our team as we strive to take the company to new heights and further increase shareholder value."

622,en,1,679,1,0.621298,positive,1,positive,0.646442,"Yes. Good question. Yes, 2021 is a better year. If you recall, we entered the pandemic -- we actually signed a purchase and sale agreement in April of 2020, which probably was right in that peak of the downturn. And so yes, we believe that the prices are better this year. We have also made investments out there to stabilize production, and also we've done a better job of looking at and actually separating out our facilities that are associated with our production and in those portions of our facilities that could be used for commercial saltwater disposal. And so we think that we can get really good value for our assets, and so we're looking forward to doing so this year."

And digging into the M&A a little bit without asking for any secret sauce, so wondered if you could give us some broad gating items with regard to M&A, both on the sort of assets that you desire and any financing variables."

626,en,1,732,1,0.70265,positive,1,positive,0.706259,"Yes. Very good. I'll address the financing first because that's the obvious thing. Yes, we've got a challenging balance sheet, okay? And so with the debt load that we have, we would like to use equity where we can. We would like to emerge from any kind of a transaction with -- making further progress. We're strengthen our balance sheet, and we think that we can do that. We believe now that prices have come back up to a more reasonable level, there are more sellers out there, if you want to call them that. There are more sellers willing to sell at these prices, whereas at the -- if you look back at -- in November, December of last year when prices were still pretty low, really, nobody wanted to sell their assets at $40 oil."
627,en,1,866,1,0.552045,positive,,positive,0.675131,"Now getting back to the portion of your question associated with what type of assets, well, we really like the area that we're in. We really like the economics of the projects that we have in our own inventory. And so yes, ideally, we would like to spread our very effective operating team over more wells and more barrels of production in the areas that we operate. So the synergies is an obvious thing. And so -- however, I'm not going to tell you that we would only buy assets in and around where we currently operate. But I will say that if we do venture outside of the Central Basin platform, the Southern Shelf, it'll be because the attributes of the acquisition bring with them similar attributes of shallow declines, high margins, undeveloped opportunity, have low breakeven costs and short payouts and that type of thing. And probably primarily oil as well."

We were originally thinking that we were going to pick up a drilling rig to start our next campaign sometime in the summer. But because of the prices being what they are, we're actually thinking about accelerating our drilling program a little bit. So don't be surprised if we start drilling in the second quarter."

I'm just curious, what's sort of the longest production history you have now at this Eastern Shelf, not the Northwest Shelf? Longest production history you have with the wells there so far? And just how much does the -- would the lateral length help the economics of the well? I think the curves you've had in past presentations have been out of a 1-mile lateral assumption."

So a lot of the first production history, I mean, the original operator there drilled wells in 2016, and other operators within the area had started drilling in '15, so there's quite a bit of production history for those wells. And as far as the 1.5-miles well, it's beneficial to get an extra 0.5 mile because you already have the location set up and you get that extra completion from that. So maybe, Marinos, you want to elaborate a little bit more?"

So everybody tries to -- as long as they have the equity position, to drill the 1.5 miles, it's been beneficial.

So after 2022, with an additional 30 to 35 rod pump conversions in 2022, we'll be at a point where all the wells that need to be converted to rod pump are done.

Although the global pandemic made it a uniquely challenging year, 2020 was nonetheless a great year financially for Canacol and its stakeholders as we continue to execute our plan to develop our growing natural gas business. Largely driven by having a full year with higher gas transportation capacity, following the completion of the pipeline expansion in August of 2019, we reported approximately $145 million in funds from operations for the full year of 2020, a 16% increase from 2019 despite sales volumes being negatively impacted by temporary COVID related reduction in demand. It impacted funds from operations for the second quarter of 2020, in particular."

Our year end net debt position of approximately $342 million was effectively unchanged from a year-ago.

We continue to plan to pay down our debt in due course rather than building up large cash balances, but we'll do so strategically to minimize our finance expenses while we maintain our financial flexibility and our ability to continue investing in our business and buying back shares when it makes sense to do so."

Financial highlights include, revenues net of transportation royalties decreased 6% to $62 million compared to $66 million for the same period in 2019, mainly due to a 6% decline in sales volumes, which was due to reduce gas demand resulting from the gas market still not being fully recovered from COVID related weakness in Q4."
735,en,1,547,1,0.51597,positive,1,positive,0.536709,"Adjusted funds flow from operations increased 7% to $35 million from $33 million in 2019 as lower revenues were more than offset by lower G&A expenses and cash taxes. EBITDAX increased 6% to $46 million from $43 million. Our cash position increased 66% to $68 million from $41 million, and net income decreased 96% to $1 million from $25 million. That year-over-year decline in net income is largely attributable to a deferred tax expense of $12 million in Q4 2020, compared to a deferred tax gain of $16 million in the comparable quarter in 2019."
736,en,1,451,1,0.868773,positive,,positive,0.864872,"Focusing solely on 2020, we see a simple trend we view as more important when we look at revenues, funds from operations and EBITDAX, all steadily recovering from the lows seen in Q2 2020 at the height of the COVID first wave in Colombia. As Charle already highlighted in his opening statement, we have reported that monthly sales volumes continued to recover in January and February, so we're optimistic that this trend will continue throughout 2021."

These results again highlight the stability and high margin nature of our gas business."

G&A for the first 12 -- for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 average just $0.42 per Mcf, 23% lower than the $0.55 per Mcf for the prior year."
739,en,1,605,1,0.943536,positive,,positive,0.841987,"To further highlight the strength and stability as well as growth that we see in our business and financial results, we want to highlight the return on capital employed -- implied by our financial statements over the last eight quarters. The COVID pandemic curtailed the positive trajectory, our return on capital employed was showing a year ago, but our return on capital employed remains very high by E&P standards at 16% on average for the full year 2020, up from 15% in 2019. And quarterly results are now demonstrating a clearly positive trend that we are optimistic will continue as we move forward."

And we are now in an increasingly enviable position of financial strength with an ability to easily maintain a steady return to shareholders and increased flexibility to ramp up investment levels when we think it makes sense to do so.

745,en,1,550,1,0.561076,positive,1,positive,0.609626,"We therefore expect to remain well-positioned to continue returning capital to shareholders, while reducing our leverage ratios and investing for growth. Although the pandemic is not over, we are progressing our drilling program with two rigs currently drilling at the Milano 1 exploration well in the Cañahuate 4 development well.

And ExxonMobil recently announced that they're applying for a permit to execute a similar pilot also in the middle Magdalena Valley. So the regulatory environment at the moment is favorable for these fracking pilots.

They're simply designed to apply typical massive hydraulic fracturing techniques here in Colombia, and monitor the impact of those operations on the environment, specifically, groundwater, micro tremors, etcetera.

So that seems to be moving ahead smoothly. With respect to potential sales volumes, there remains a deficit still in the electrical market related to the delay of Ituango hydroelectric project. So there's a 2,500 megawatt deficit in the hydro space.

I can't -- at this point in time, I can't give you any clear goals or targets. Obviously, we're cognizant of share price fluctuations, when it may be more opportune as to less. I will say that some of you probably on the line probably received questionnaires that Canacol sent out. We're actively soliciting shareholders thoughts with respect to what they viewed as more valuable, increased dividends or increased share buybacks or increased debt repayments.

805,en,1,849,1,-0.442329,negative,1,negative,-0.257119,"Yes, that's a very good question. This relates directly to a deferred tax write-down we did in Q4. So in late 2020, a Council of State Court ruling essentially disallowed the use of losses on merge companies. So the particular case that was in front of the court at that point in time was not an oil and gas case. And it had different facts, circumstances than the Canacol case. It's probably important to note that the DN [ph] has yet to change the tax laws to reflect that particular court's ruling. So as you can imagine that has affected many companies, and many challenges to that ruling are expected in the near future, with Canacol being one of those challenges. So many experts believe the ruling is unconstitutional. And it was due to the ambiguity surrounding that ruling that we do recognize the deferred tax assets on our balance sheets."

I should note that it was that particular court only disallowed certain tax losses in that particular case. So, we're hopeful that we will get that back and obviously we're working with local experts via constitution or tax wise on that particular topic. But we ended with 60 -- at the end of the year with $68 million in cash. We've got a $46 million revolving line of credit that is untouched, and our budgets would not be looking to touch that.

But in general, we've been shifting our exploration away from Esperanza, which are where Nelson and Palmer are located and where we did our first exploration, 5, 6 years ago. We've been shifting more and more exploration activity into VIM-5, which is where Clarinete and Pandereta are located. So yes, the new discoveries were making -- the big new discoveries we're making tend to be located in Clarinete and the VIM-5 area.

916,en,1,515,1,0.929302,positive,,positive,0.927676,"Thank you, Alberto. So gentlemen, ladies, we have experienced an extreme and foreseeable scenario. Headwinds came from all over the places, ranging from macro variables to operating dynamics. Despite this challenging environment, we have been able to deliver a very solid operating and financial performance with a 9% growth in net ordinary income. This confirms once again the sustainability of the business model we have. This has been able to deliver an outstanding growth level, even against sudden disruptions."
917,en,1,417,1,0.95746,positive,,positive,0.956767,"Our solid operating deployment across all the business lines positions us as a leader in the utility space, a renewable super major that can rely on a resilient and digitized network, which will be the backbone of the energy transition of the future, supporting also the increasing electrification of consumption. This opens up new business opportunities that will enhance the value to our customers and shareholders."
918,en,1,577,1,0.849908,positive,,positive,0.867921,"Our highly digitized- and platform-based business has allowed us to act promptly and to take proactive measures to protect our people first and ensure that, at the same time, business continuity. I have to underline here the extremely professional behavior of all our workforce that made all this possible. The delivery recorded in 2020, coupled with the managerial actions we put in place to cope with this exceptional year, have generated further value that resulted in a top quartile performance of the utility sector with a 22 total shareholder return during the 2020 year."

We receive them from Goldman Sachs, Banca Akros, Barclays, Morgan Staley, Mediobanca, Citigroup, SocGen, Santander, Crédit Suisse, Equita, Capitol, Stifel, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Exane, UBS and Merrill Lynch. Thank you all."
923,en,1,272,1,-0.703799,negative,,negative,-0.611933,"I will start from the first one to the CEO. I think he's one of the most popular. So far, 2021 has seen some doubt on renewable, which led to a rebalancing and sell-off of the most exposed names. Can you share with us your view on the sector and our returns going forward?"
924,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Francesco Starace
925,en,1,339,1,0.731655,positive,,positive,0.845955,"Okay. There are basically two questions here is -- two observations. One is the one on the dynamic of prices and competition, with one on the, let's say, share performance of some players. I think there is some technical adjustments that took place. There are some technical adjustments that took place with the rebalancing of the indexes."
926,en,1,392,1,0.445336,positive,,positive,0.401287,"I think the markets seem to have switched quite quickly the sentiment also on the back of some business events that were kind of surprising during the year. I think the key common conclusion deriving from this event is that the returns may not be at par with the expectation, and that delivery in terms of capacity commission might not be in line with targets communicated by several players."
927,en,1,543,1,0.36852,positive,1,positive,0.347056,"Now let me recall some of the measures, some of the messages that we set out when we delivered our Capital Market Day. The first one is that the dimension and the expansion of the space in renewables is such that it can accommodate for all the relevant players today and more. And that it does not really have any threat of becoming congested or crowded space. So there is not an issue on space of growth. And we didn't see any change during the 2020 year. Prices will go down over time, and this is something that we have also clearly stated."
928,en,1,404,1,0.645322,positive,1,positive,0.654188,"It is -- has always been our view. And this clearly will shave off some of the expected returns of some players. But the access to customers, the platform of the development, the management of the assets and the efficiency of the organization, so that means the competitiveness and the size and the focus of the organization will determine the capability of any player to deliver on the expected returns."
929,en,1,329,1,0.902153,positive,,positive,0.897606,"The adoption of an integrated business model and a multi-technology integrated business model allows to better absorb external shocks to optimize the risk return profile. I think you will see that even more evidently, when you start to see and it is beginning to show the divergence between pure players and integrated companies."
930,en,1,283,1,0.460512,positive,1,positive,0.452978,"So we believe the market is getting this logic, is getting also the protective mix of activities that the group has. And therefore, it is not a surprise that we did not see the same trend in our share when compared to other peers or other players that have not the same risk profile."
931,en,1,254,1,0.661751,positive,1,positive,0.645132,"Overall, I think the story is still very solid. There is a trend competitiveness in renewals. It's always been our view, and it's now showing maybe more clearly than before. And therefore, some say some companies might get a little bit penalized by that."

Francesco, can you share with us some update when the transaction with Macquarie is expected to be finalized? And what's the stake that you expect to sell?"

It is going to be between 40% to 50% maximum, in the next few months or weeks and months, this is going to be basically completed. To where do we stand? The discussions are now being held between Macquarie, the buyer of our share and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, CDP, the other shareholder, and the discussions are about the governance. So what kind of governance the two players want to have going forward."
936,en,1,420,1,0.31091,positive,1,positive,0.290659,"Let's say that this is not rocket science. It's a governance about -- a company that has one infrastructure as a mission. It is in one country, Italy, and the shareholders are 2, out of which one has a consolidating stake. So let's say, it's governance 101 for -- as far as this is concerned, and it will not take that much to be finalized. We expect, therefore, the transaction by -- to be certainly closed by year-end."
937,en,1,240,1,0.884711,positive,,positive,0.851016,"Of course, we will update you as soon as this is clear, as soon as the last steps are completed. Again, this is a very clear example of how much we can create value when we implement a stewardship model in this kind of infrastructure place."

No. We did not get any signal that this still is an item of discussion at all in the present situation at the present government. So there is no signals on that, okay? So that we don't get a question on this."

949,en,1,476,1,0.880963,positive,,positive,0.880963,"I think as soon as we finished with the PTO, we will sit with the residual minority shareholders and define what are the key strategic options that Américas has to maximize value creation going forward? One of the many options is also to be more selective in terms of the geographies where we want to continue to operate in Latin America in the light of their growth perspective, their stability and the potential creation of value that we can pursue in different geographies."
950,en,1,432,1,0.365797,positive,1,positive,0.433516,"Based on this, we will decide having listened also, of course, to all the minority shareholders. And therefore, we will proceed to simplify maybe also the geographical positioning in the four countries that are today part of Enel Américas. I said four, but it's wrong. They are actually seven because there are three minor countries in Central America that are now part of the portfolio of the country. So there are seven countries."

952,en,1,279,1,-0.424356,negative,,negative,-0.90144,"Okay. We move to the CFO for another really popular question. Currencies were a major headwind in 2020 and are still showing weakness. In light of the gap between your scenario and the forward curves, what is the expected impact for 2021? There is any clear risk to the guidance?"
953,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
954,en,1,493,1,0.261727,positive,1,negative,-0.276305,"Yes, we are. Sorry. For 2020, yes, we -- it was the main headwind we had, €1 billion of impact. So there is -- so we recovered the COVID impact, but we will leave a €1 billion impact on FX. First month of the year, some signs of weakness still present in FX currencies, with some signs of different win to move, mainly in Brazil, which headwinds had been more impacted by some things and not by the general scenario? It's too early to say because the first two months, vaccination in progress."
955,en,1,523,1,0.673242,positive,,positive,0.675848,"So we think that we will have a clear view of the overall impact, looking at the second half of the year and not in the first two months of this year. A pure mark-to-market now may, so are applying €300 million, €350 million impact that we think will not stay along the year. But on the other side, I said we have many party movements in our profit and loss, mainly the good results of our stewardship model that can -- so I'd say it's not easy but can cover some headwinds if, at the end, we will have some impact from FX."
956,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Monica Girardi
957,en,1,252,1,0.431758,positive,1,negative,-0.256527,"Okay. So I guess the bottom line is that no, the guidance is not at risk. Now we still -- another one on guidance, actually. Net debt is well below the guidance provided for the year. Will this improvement carry over to the 2021, 2023 net debt figures?"
958,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
959,en,1,415,1,0.33475,positive,1,positive,0.508345,"Well, the general answer is no. So we think we have -- the trend of our debt is fully in line with what we have presented for the three years' plan. The main driver of changes in 2020 is based on sort of the timing of the hybrid bond equity accounting because in our projections, we included only €600 million because we didn't include the concepts of solicitation that we launched at the end of 2020 that occurred."
960,en,1,302,1,0.672174,positive,1,positive,0.559383,"So -- but we had projecting these solicitation for 2021. So it's only the main part is a timing difference then we have some saving but not in the numbers that you see. And so savings, better results is in the range of €200 million, €300 million, and the rest is timing difference on hybrid accounting."
961,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Monica Girardi
962,en,1,239,1,0.601584,positive,,neutral,0.0,"Okay. Alberto, still with you on working capital dynamics, which are the main drivers of the strong improvement in working capital from the nine months, is the reduction fully associated with the reabsorption of the negative COVID effects?"
963,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
964,en,1,341,1,0.77982,positive,,positive,0.818244,"Well, yes. First of all, yes. So the vast majority is the absorption of COVID effect that we have shown in the first half. Well, I think a combination of two things: one, some new actions that we put in place to recover mainly, so moving to digital payment's a huge part of our customer base along the year. And this is one of the main part."
965,en,1,506,1,0.314095,positive,1,positive,0.287172,And the second is that some regulators maybe so focused in Brazil that has -- was the more -- the most active in this. So they gave us some aids in financial aids. So the impact in Brazil accounted for almost €600 million and was -- so the main action to solve the financial problems of the Brazilian distributors that was related to the delay in payments for customers are caused by the lockdown and others. These two main things allow us to recover almost in full the impact of working capital for COVID.
966,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Monica Girardi
967,en,1,124,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Okay. Still on the COVID-19, analysts are asking if we can provide a breakdown of the COVID-19 impacts on business segments."

969,en,1,227,1,0.472884,positive,,positive,0.503163,"Okay. So first of all, as said, so the €1 billion impact of FX, so it's not directly connected to COVID, but so it's clearly related to this. Out of this impact, as said, we had a €730 million impact on EBITDA because of COVID."
970,en,1,345,1,-0.792785,negative,,negative,-0.74184,"As I said in the presentation, €600 million are mainly related with the contraction volumes and €130 million related with other things, and the main are losses on the network front. So the time in which we can't act against frauds. So fraud, we had a huge increase in frauds, then another €60 million, €70 million was a delay in the development."
971,en,1,220,1,0.324464,positive,1,positive,0.412038,"But on the other side, we can have also -- we had also positive impact because we have a huge decrease in OpEx. I don't know, travel expenses and other kind of OpEx that was main related with the new situation for COVID."
972,en,1,484,1,0.427899,positive,1,positive,0.479552,"When it comes to countries, I would say that Italy was resilient at all, so the impact is 0, with different moving parts that bring the country to these results. Iberia impacted the more, roughly €100 million, mainly because of this long position in the hedge contracts that -- so it's the one-off effect of the sharp contraction of demand. And the rest is Latin America. And Latin America is both the volume contraction and on the other side, bad debt and stop of downing activities."
973,en,1,330,1,-0.418105,negative,,negative,-0.423611,"When it comes to the business lines, the most impacted lines are the lines that work on volumes. So retail mainly for the loan position in Italy, Spain and distribution, mainly for the demand contraction in Latin America, where -- so regulators, so the regulatory framework don't give any kind of shed to the reduction in volumes."

975,en,1,347,1,0.293347,positive,1,negative,-0.335614,"Okay. Francesco, we go back to you on a -- with a question on renewables. So renewable addition came in at 3,100 megawatts but were impacted by COVID. Can you remind us what would have been the level of new capacity in absence of the pandemic? And what do you expect for 2021 in terms of delivery? Is there any further risk from COVID you see now?"
976,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Francesco Starace
977,en,1,228,1,-0.294223,negative,1,negative,-0.3971,"Yes. No. So let's see, the additional built that we missed to put into the 2020 year is around 800 megawatts, as we said. So we would have been slightly below 4,000 megawatts without any COVID impact, if we have no COVID impact."
978,en,1,337,1,-0.316832,negative,,negative,-0.595076,"Now what happens during 2021 is that, yes, this 800 megawatts are rolled into the 2021 target. We expect to recover fully during 2021. And then, therefore, to go above the 5,000-megawatt threshold quite substantially during the 2021 year. So '21 year will not only recover the delay of 2020, but also accelerate further compared to 2020."
979,en,1,349,1,-0.866973,negative,,negative,-0.86468,"Frankly, no, we don't see any residual risk, so COVID in term -- as far as installations are concerned. You might recall that I mentioned these facts at the beginning of the pandemic that we anticipated some slowdown on permitting because of public administrations around the world being confined at home or not really as effective or as productive."
980,en,1,239,1,-0.38072,negative,1,negative,-0.377098,"If you can use this word, on the permitting phase, and therefore, some impact on further down the road. So far, we don't see an impact in '22. We are assessing if there is anything on '23, so no impact at this point. We think this is over."

982,en,1,213,1,0.70649,positive,,positive,0.795583,"Okay. Again with you, Francesco, you have shown meaningful progress in 2020 on phasing out generation from coal. What is the status of discussion with governments in shutting down coal plants, especially in Italy?"
983,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Francesco Starace
984,en,1,442,1,0.771202,positive,,positive,0.703232,"So you know that we have a commitment to phase out coal. And during the CMD, we said '27 as the end date. And we are working basically with screed operators, governments, local communities in order to do this by then. This is -- let's face -- let's understand what we are talking about. We are talking about disconnecting plants from the networks, okay? So if you look at phasing-out action, this is already taking place in a spectacular way."
985,en,1,416,1,-0.292832,negative,,positive,0.747906,"We went down 65% on coal this year 2020. This will continue to go -- to come. So the production will be extremely marginal going forward, but the symbolic and substantial disconnection from the grid of an infrastructure requires an agreement from network operators that need to be, let's say, comfortable with the fact that if this capacity is withdrawn from the system, the system can withstand shocks of all kinds."
986,en,1,527,1,0.423655,positive,1,positive,0.389143,"So where do we stand with this? We have an early shutdown during 2020. We got an early shutdown from Italy -- from Italian network operator and authorities to take out the first unit of the Brindisi power plant, which is now being dismantled, and to take up two out of four units of the Fusina power plant by 2021, which is going on. So this is according to plan. That's okay. We have discussion in Spain with the phaseout of [indiscernible] following the decision of closing, which has been communicated and has been accepted."
987,en,1,534,1,0.983783,positive,,positive,0.900824,"The question today is basically, therefore, not a question of reducing production. It's basically going to stop way before 2027, but rather making comfortable the operator -- network operators that's taking the plants off the grid, poses no risk to the stability of the grid itself, which is something that we are working at, and it's something that we are quite confident we can achieve by 2027. So we are in good track in this space. And we are ahead of the curve when you look at the actual production from the existing facilities."

991,en,1,419,1,0.682852,positive,,positive,0.6963,"So this is a little bit more in the future than people would think, but anyway. So yes, we have a commitment on the green hydrogen front, so on hydrogen produced by hydrolysis. And the commitment we have is to -- through the implementation of some projects, push the boundaries of this technology and drive the evolution of this technology in order to find out if the cost of the electrolyzers can drop a factor of six."
992,en,1,530,1,0.310786,positive,1,negative,-0.411673,"So it can drop from $1,200 per kilowatt to about $200 per kilowatt. This is what it takes, coupled with the renewable energy costs. So today, we have already reached. This is what it takes to bring green hydrogen at par with the present hydrogen costs. Without that, failing that, this technology will never really pick up, if not for some niches of very specific applications. So our goal is to work with various partners in different countries. We have projects in Italy. We have projects in Spain. The largest one are in Spain."
993,en,1,313,1,0.755338,positive,,positive,0.877296,"And we have project in Chile, and we have projects in the U.S. to use these projects in order to push and get possibly a solution to this, cost issue on investment, cost issue on the electrolyzers and understand this technology fully. The next 10 years should be enough in order to establish whether this happens."

998,en,1,339,1,0.526952,positive,,negative,-0.516152,"Let me answer also for the other three countries in Europe where we are present, which are Spain, Greece and Romania. So the deadline that a commission has set has -- as a latest possible date, the end of April. Some countries like Spain have already advanced their proposals. Some countries like Italy have not yet done the full homework."
999,en,1,539,1,0.966967,positive,,positive,0.946862,"But let's say that within April, all the initiatives will have to be presented to the European task force that manages this incredible task of understanding which projects fit and which projects do not fit the logic and the criteria of the EU. To do that, the European Union has eight weeks, so two months to respond with various feedbacks. And then the European Council needs to have an approval of four weeks. So we think that including a potential pre-financing of 10%, member states could get the first money streams within 2021, okay?"
1000,en,1,512,1,0.650443,positive,,positive,0.650443,"I'm saying this because you need to have -- in order for this flow of money to really materialize, you need to have to establish the allocation procedures on a competitive basis in respecting all the guidelines on state aid that are important for private players like we are or you need to have regulatory framework changes in order for the same to happen on regulated concessionary businesses as we have also that cannot play on a competitive basis. So there are two parallel tracks that need to be established."
1001,en,1,562,1,0.534255,positive,1,positive,0.512254,"All in all, I think there are several areas where this can happen. Let me just give you a little bit of a rule of thumb. It's easier to accelerate the pace of project implementation and activity of something that is already moving -- that something that already has an entrant on its own. So in other words, if we have, as we do in many countries, a large flow of investment already in some businesses, it's easier to increase that and therefore be at the early part of the disbursement of these funds. It's less easy to jump-start something that does not exist."
1002,en,1,515,1,0.846446,positive,,positive,0.855954,"Let's take the hydrogen things. They need to be designed. They need to be permitted, and therefore, they will be able to capture flows of money, sizable flows of money only probably a little later than networks, for example, or accelerated deployment of digital meters or infrastructure of this case. But because we are in both fields, we are optimally positioned to benefit from this flow of money in a uniform way across the different geographies. So we are very confident that this will be quite possible for us."
1003,en,1,279,1,0.515351,positive,1,positive,0.518623,"Let's not forget the dimensions that European Unions are facing are looking for are totally in line with our strategy.

1106,en,1,340,1,0.357989,positive,1,positive,0.344506,"That roughly is 1 terawatt hour more. In Iberia, volumes are down overall 11%. B2B contraction was up 13%. We are talking about roughly 8 terawatt hours, with B2C down 4%. Also here is less than 1 terawatt hour. Overall, the contraction of industrial activities is the main driver for the contraction. And now we see a progressive recovery."
1107,en,1,473,1,0.708247,positive,,positive,0.662839,"Worth mentioning that the reduction in the B2B segment is the -- as the less marginality in the overall portfolio of our selling, that's why -- so the increase in B2C, with a higher level of marginality, covered almost entirely the reduction in marginality coming from B2B. And the only impact, really impact that we had on retail in 2020 was the long position, the temporary long position that was created by the sharp contraction in the B2B demand following the lockdown."

1109,en,1,329,1,0.647492,positive,,positive,0.61313,"Okay. So you spent a few words on the margins, which I think is also answering another question associated with B2B and B2C for Italy and Spain. So we move to a question which asked the latest observation around demand in Italy and Spain. So have you seen recently any recovery? What are the residual risks associated with COVID?"

1111,en,1,353,1,0.652919,positive,1,positive,0.543135,"Yes. So in the first two months, we know a big bump, but we are observing a little trend of recovery that started in the second half of last year with some stop and go along the second part of 2020. Today, we see the electricity demand is flat in Italy and with minus 1% in Spain. So this is a steady recovery of demand that we observed along the month."

1113,en,1,334,1,0.546321,positive,,positive,0.529105,Okay. I think we are approaching the two last questions and are both for the CFO. One is on the hybrid. So we move to the financials. So you have €2.1 billion hybrid bonds still accounted as debt. Are you going to change the maturity to perpetual and accounting as equity from now onwards? Will all the hybrids be accounted as equity?
1114,en,1,16,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Alberto De Paoli
1115,en,1,555,1,0.817745,positive,,positive,0.807336,"Well, so we have started the process last year, as you know, and so we are looking to continue to do so also in the next year. We will use, depending on the overall impact, consent solicitation like we did for the first time in the last year or so we will wait the refinancing time for other. So it will depend on the market condition. And so we will evaluate accordingly with the best approach. At the beginning of this month, I remember that we have just issued the new hybrids for €2.25 billion, and these new hybrids will be fully accounted as equity."
1116,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Monica Girardi
1117,en,1,145,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Okay. Last one, the expectation of a less favorable interest rate environment can change or accelerate the deployment of your financial strategy?"

1119,en,1,321,1,0.422711,positive,1,positive,0.376516,"Well, we constantly monitor the evolution of economic and financial environment. To give you an example, we took for the hybrid bonds, a clear wind between 2x of some tool bullets in the market. The window was very clear. And so we get a very, very low level of cost. So the hybrid we issued had the overall cost of 1.7%."
1120,en,1,334,1,0.887638,positive,,positive,0.883349,"I think the lowest level of cost for a hybrid bond. And so we will do it also looking forward. I think that a lot of windows will be ready to refinance the debt. And so I would say, so we will -- I think we will have another one year or one. Five years of level-playing fields to finance or refinance the debt, but we worked that way."
1121,en,1,224,1,0.718711,positive,,positive,0.886432,"So the final answer is, I think, that we don't have any kind of impact for the foreseeable future, but also tactically speaking, we are working on windows being ready to do something soon as the condition are so easy for us."

Since our last earnings call, they've completed a historic peak season and using the power of our expanded seven-day-a-week FedEx Ground operations, our team handled record-breaking volumes throughout the holiday shipping season."

They worked night and day to move the backlog quickly and as safely as possible. This includes the many team members who typically perform other duties and volunteered their time to help. We're sincerely grateful to them and to our customers for their understanding, as we navigated the effects of these massive winter storms."

The center will build on the Yale legacy of the school and the environment of world-class research and education to develop measurable carbon capture solutions, with an initial focus on helping to offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions. Findings will be published and shared so that businesses, industries, and governments globally can benefit from this work."

1180,en,1,409,1,0.873012,positive,,positive,0.877241,"Thank you, Fred and good afternoon everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter of growth for FedEx. Despite challenging circumstances, the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company's history. This included delivering nearly 0.5 billion holiday packages, transporting the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines here in the US, and increasing collaboration across operating companies."
1181,en,1,425,1,0.754323,positive,,positive,0.817554,"Our results speak for themselves. In December, we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company's history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years. We better maximized our available capacity, and as Brie will cover in a moment, better aligned prices to incremental costs. Peak 2020 was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons."
1182,en,1,185,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.44266,"As Fred mentioned, our operations were impacted by last month's severe winter weather throughout the United States. Mike will expand more on the scope and unique nature of these storms."

We implemented numerous contingencies to mitigate the impact, including adding sorts, line haul and collaborating across our network to assist in the recovery. I'm very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation."
1184,en,1,312,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Now, speaking of the team, we announced that Henry Maier will retire this summer and named John Smith, former President and CEO of FedEx Freight, his successor.

1185,en,1,338,1,0.979143,positive,,positive,0.982818,"Now, turning to FedEx Ground. The outstanding margin improvement for Ground in Q3 highlights the success of our ongoing strategic initiatives and investments to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the last mile even amid record residential volume levels. These investments continue to pay off. Let me share three examples."
1186,en,1,478,1,0.693968,positive,,positive,0.905281,"Number one, we saw a meaningful improvement in last mile efficiency as service providers improve their stops per hour 21% year-over-year in Q3. Number two, the average cost per stop decreased by 12% year-over-year. And number three, we maximized our assets, expanding to seven-day operations and integrating Ground economy, or formerly FedEx SmartPost, reduced our fixed cost per package by 4% year-over-year. We remain very optimistic for continued profitable growth at Ground."
1187,en,1,277,1,0.917119,positive,,positive,0.917119,"Collaboration between operating companies continue at an unprecedented rate in Q3.

Additionally, FedEx Freight has delivered more than 1.75 million shipments for Ground so far this fiscal year. This time last year, Freight had yet to deliver a single Ground shipment as increased support for Ground kicked off in May of 2020."
1189,en,1,448,1,0.703242,positive,,positive,0.708886,"Finally, turning to FedEx Express. Our global network is moving COVID-19 vaccines, ingredients and supplies as we speak. It has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. At FedEx Express, we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. We know, however, that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term, and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market."
1190,en,1,535,1,0.871042,positive,,positive,0.86966,"In addition, we will continue to improve our efficiency by executing last mile optimization and transforming our European business. In Europe, momentum continues with the physical integration of the TNT network. We recently announced our Europe restructuring program, and we are progressing with local consultations as planned and in accordance with local market regulations. April will be a big month as we prepare to roll out a set of new service capabilities for our customers, which Brie will provide more detail very shortly here."
1191,en,1,375,1,0.80829,positive,,positive,0.81358,"We'll complete their integration in spring 2022, which will bring the physical network integration to a close.

We remain focused on optimizing the network and strengthening our capabilities to drive upside in Europe for years to come."

Our primary focus is ensuring large customer pricing aligns to their volume distribution. We continue to manage capacity at FedEx Ground, prioritizing our highest yielding SAM segment as well as our premium home delivery product.

With these projections, demand trends will continue to favor freighters and integrators. We are confident in our ability to maintain elevated yields for at least 12 months. With e-commerce driving significant growth internationally, we will increasingly utilize peak surcharges in our international business."

One, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B and the verticals, particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID, which is on every single box of vaccines that we're now delivering. I mean, it's almost been flawless, the execution of that. And you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines we've delivered in the millions."

It helps on both sides, which is what Don mentioned about the density, because as we get more residential packages that are not Express in nature, time definite, or something that somebody needs in a residence that Express has to deliver, it helps Ground's density, its cost, its asset utilization."

In the grand scheme of things, when you look at almost 20 million packages a day moving through our network, this represents a very small portion of that.

We will have; actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration. That will provide growth, both from a B2B perspective, as well as a B2C perspective. So we are absolutely looking to take share intra-Europe, and we see that with the fastest network in Europe.

When you think about FICP, its features of service are different from our core B2B products in a couple of ways. Number one, we've changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have low-value clearance capabilities, or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile."

So in all three of these segments, we believe we've got market share upside, but probably most specifically, on the overnight service to the United States, it's a B2B play.

1424,en,1,404,1,0.782022,positive,,positive,0.854382,"But I can tell you that while this has been the most difficult crisis of our history and our industry as well as Delta, as a company, I could not be more proud of our people. The great work they've done, the resilience they've shown, the focus about taking care of our customers and our operations, our cash, and so protecting our future to be able to talk to where we're going to be going is remarkable."
1425,en,1,380,1,0.794222,positive,,positive,0.953064,"And I think that over the course of the last year, we've got into this point that we can start to have real -- substantial discussions of the path forward and not only the path forward, but how we're going to emerge from this as a stronger airline, as a more resilient airline, and the things that we've learned over the course of the last year has really, really been phenomenal."

And we start to see a -- what I consider real glimmers of hope. And we've seen some glimmers of hope over the course of the last year, but they've been false hope, I think -- in most regards, but this seems like it's real, it seems substantive. And we've got a long ways to go yet. We're in a much, much better place than we've been in quite a period of time."

1429,en,1,339,1,0.616615,positive,1,positive,0.596423,"The real story for the quarter, kicked in about, five or six weeks ago when we started to see bookings pickup. And that coincided, clearly, with confidence in the marketplace. People are starting to book their spring and summer plans, and Glen’s going to be giving you an update on the commercial front, in terms of what that means for us."
1430,en,1,199,1,0.858495,positive,,positive,0.858495,"When we look within our quarter, it looks to us that, for the month of March we expect our top line revenues to be about 40% higher, than what we saw in the month of February, which is a big step-up."
1431,en,1,275,1,0.886047,positive,,positive,0.885482,"Of course, you always expect a meaningful step-up from February to March. And so, it's good to see some traditional seasonality starting to come out. Historically, that seasonality has been in the low-to-mid 30 range. So, to get to 40% step-up from February to March is nice."

1433,en,1,276,1,0.31675,positive,1,positive,0.42967,"Cash burn, for us is coming in pretty close to the mid-point of what we forecasted. We forecasted at the start of the quarter a cash burn on a daily basis of between $10 million and $15 million a day; looks like it's going to come in between $12 million and $14 million a day."
1434,en,1,239,1,-0.702706,negative,,negative,-0.702706,"But the thing that we've noticed in cash burn and probably for me, one of the big takeaways for our conference today is, at Delta, we expect in the month of March to be at or pretty darn close to breakeven for the month of March cash burn."
1435,en,1,172,1,0.343322,positive,,positive,0.343322,"So cash burn for the month of March, because of the booking improvements that we've seen over the course of the last few weeks, it is going to come in pretty close to zero."

1437,en,1,279,1,0.928501,positive,,positive,0.932784,"And I continue to be cautiously optimistic that we will see the traction where we're seeing here, we're going to hold it. And then, as the recovery continues to take shape, gain strength into the summer, with the return to profitability for Delta, hopefully in the third quarter."
1438,en,1,346,1,0.754234,positive,,positive,0.776531,"Now, of course, those forecasts are expectation that the vaccines will continue to rollout, that herd immunity will probably be achieved in our country, probably, hopefully, at some point in the latter part of the second quarter, the late spring or early summer. And that gives confidence back to domestic travel, coming back out in a robust way."

As the US case counts came down from their late January peak, and vaccinations continued to run out in the marketplace. So we've seen what we would consider to be a lot of pent-up demand for primarily domestic and short-haul international leisure travel."

And of course, our look-to-book ratios are continuing to strengthen. So we've seen across all AP windows some very good strength. And that's really to talk a little bit about that, that's very different from anywhere else that we've been in the pandemic with – the further out bookings now starting to come in."
1447,en,1,453,1,0.445447,positive,1,positive,0.444192,"The one thing that was consistent throughout the entire pandemic was the compression of the booking window were inside of 14 and inside of six days, where most of your bookings resided. And really in the past six weeks, we've seen that move out, so that bookings that are beyond 60 days are almost flat to 2019 levels, just down a few points. And that's a very different situation from where we've been in the last year, so very encouraging signs there."
1448,en,1,285,1,-0.349701,negative,,positive,0.579774,"Corporate, as Ed mentioned is still slowly, but steadily building back. We’re in high-teens to low 20s in terms of corporate. And those are major corporations, SMEs are slightly ahead of that and they've been accelerating at a slightly higher pace than the true large corporate travel."
1449,en,1,365,1,0.445764,positive,1,positive,0.500094,"But we do expect that from all the surveys that we've seen out in the marketplace that that will continue to accelerate with many people returning to the office late in 2Q or early in 3Q. So setting up well as we go through the historic leisure period of the summer to have significant increase in bookings for business, as we turn into the fall as looking forward."
1450,en,1,464,1,0.614359,positive,,positive,0.834537,"We have, of course not yet released our middle seat. Our middle seat block is still in place. And that is going to be an incredibly powerful tool. If you think that we were able to get to cash breakeven in the month of March with over 30% of our inventory that's out flying not being sold, as demand continues to return. And as we release those seats into the future, that's going to be an incredibly strong lever for us with very minimal cost open those seats up."
1451,en,1,447,1,0.778478,positive,,positive,0.772487,"So I think, where we're sitting right now is a very different place than where we were sitting last we spoke, and one that we're very encouraged with and one that we see signs across the board. I would say, the one thing that's still the wild card is the long-haul international and when that will open up and we've been working very hard as you know, we have several corridors open for quarantine pre-travel to Europe, which are doing quite well."
1452,en,1,489,1,0.595401,positive,1,positive,0.565046,"But while we're doing very well in the US right now with case counts continuing to decline and vaccinations continuing to accelerate, that's not the case all over the world yet. So we think that's going to be a spotty return. And hopefully, we can get towards late summer a reopening of the Transatlantic, which would be the next thing we really need to achieve here. So lots of encouraging signs, but lots of room to grow and lots of room to continue to improve as we move through spring."

1457,en,1,425,1,0.532228,positive,,positive,0.533165,"That liquidity guide that I gave of 16.5 is lower than what we guided back in January, largely due to the decision that we made to repay the $1.5 billion of slots, gates and routes term loan that we took out in the March quarter, a year ago. This brings our total debt repayments to over $7 billion since October, includes the revolver, the 364-day term loan as well as the slots, gates and routes term loan that I mentioned."

Your good friend, Paul Jacobson in the past spoke about a profitable cohabitation with ultra low cost carriers, but these airlines are undoubtedly emboldened by the downturn. We've got some startups in the wings. They're the tip of the recovery sphere, because they are all leisure, they don't have corporate or international networks to worry about. How does the pandemic change the domestic interplay between operating models? And why shouldn't we assume that discounters emerge with more share and Delta with less?"

And I think when you think about what our objective has been through the pandemic, it has continued to offer best-in-class, no matter what your travel needs are. And I'd say one of the things that we all will work on as we continue to release the seats, or as we look to release the seats towards the summer is that, we will have more seats in the lower fare categories."
1469,en,1,520,1,0.427939,positive,1,positive,0.459696,"And I think when you look at, what some of our objectives were going through the pandemic was to make sure we came out stronger and that in the places that we chose to compete that, we did not see share. And I think when you look at how we've done even with this seat block in all of our core hubs; we have maintained the share levels at pre-pandemic levels. And we think that will serve as well as we continue to move towards the back end of this and – and are able to put the full level of inventory back in play here."

But the other thing that we've been working on through the pandemic is improving our fleet mix. And you know, that peaceful cohabitation that Paul described was when we are able to put our large stage equipment up against them, some of our highest margins are directly against your LCC –in LCC market. So that's another piece that we've accelerated in the pandemic. So I think we're going to come through as I mentioned earlier, stronger than ever."

Well, let's bring Ed into that conversation because the initial market view several months ago was that, Delta and the industry would not return to prior margin levels, given due to corporate demand, higher debt levels and so forth. Obviously, the markets view is far more optimistic today. But what level of confidence do you have that Delta cannot only return to but exceed your prior margins and what are the primary drivers there?"

I think we've got a real – a real good path to do that. When you think about three of the core ingredients to that first of all, the strength of our customer interactions, the strength of our brand, arguably has never been stronger. As we've gone through the pandemic, we've seen a full 20 point increase in Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores are in the 70 range."

I think we – over the course of the last -- the last couple of quarters, we've generated more passenger revenue compared to our main competitors, despite the fact that we had significantly fewer seats available for sale, that really strengthens the proposition of the Delta brand."

And by the way, it's not just the middle seat block, that's been a part of it. But it's really been the great work our team has done throughout that. So I think we're entering through this with a stronger brand and more differentiated brand."

We've retired 200 of our oldest planes, we've got another 200 planes that we're going to be accelerating the retirement of that those efficiencies that we're going to – we're going to garner from that, we've looked at – our staffing were down about 20% in overall headcount because of the early retirement arrangements. And we've had to be pretty creative than how we've managed our cost. Our costs have been down close to 50% throughout the pandemic, and there's a lot that we've gained from that.

And I think on a year-over-year basis we're down less than 10% on a year-over-year basis in terms of what Amex is seeing in terms of total co-brand spend on the Delta Card, largely because of T&E being down in such a material way."

How should we think about future Latin American profitability, post bankruptcy for LatAm and Aeroméxico? What does that mean for the JV and Delta's results in that region?"

As Ed said earlier, our international partners have not received the support from their respective governments the U.S. carriers have received from there. And that has led to a rash of bankruptcies and consolidations across the map."
1496,en,1,436,1,0.580818,positive,1,positive,0.586484,"And I think, how we look at this is that, our partners will emerge stronger, and our ability to connect with our partners will -- across the globe will allow us to have higher returns moving forward. And so, what you seen is, the weakest of the week have either restructured or gone away depending on the entity and will not be coming back with the amount of capacity or with the ferocious appetite for growth that they had in the past."
1497,en,1,530,1,0.927018,positive,,positive,0.918341,"So I think whether you're looking at Latin or whether you're looking at Trans-Atlantic, or even in the Trans-Pacific, we're emerging from this in a very different position than we were going in. And as Ed said, when you combine that with our fleet improvements internationally with the fleet renewal that we've been working on through the pandemic, I think you can easily see where we can make significant improvements in every region with our partners and with our new fleet as we emerge from this. So, very exciting time for us."

And by the end of the year, you were back talking about the great partnership that you have with Airbus on the fleet renewal and so forth."

How you're thinking about that, and how you're thinking about ESG, which I think is post pandemic, obviously, one of the biggest issues that we're all facing as stakeholders here in the airline industry?"

And you're right, in the throes of the virus, I was looking at some numbers the other day that on April 4 -- now that our TSA count as an industry are back over 1 million a day and rising, April 14 or so was about the low point, which I think is when we had that earnings call in the first quarter. I think the TSA count for the industry was 87,000 people, it's just stunning. So, yes, in the throes of that, we suspended not just deliveries and payments of aircraft, but just about everything that we could find."

And we've worked creatively."

We took over the -- in the latter part of the year, last year the 220-300, launched a new fleet for us; it's doing well in the mix. And as we look forward, a big, big part of our recovery is they continue to upgauge with more domestic network, which is going to be predicated on the Airbus 321s that we will continue to take as we eliminated many, many of our -- large number, the 200 aircraft I talked about that retired over the last year, were small domestic narrowbody, smaller gauged aircraft."

How does that fit in with fleet right now and have you -- I mean, pre-pandemic, we've had some conversations about the old Delta, the Old Northwest, certainly, right would run planes into the ground, running forever, and so forth. And there seem definitely to be a shift towards renewing the fleet even before we were in the pandemic. Obviously, I'm just sort of wondering, right now, on the carbon side, how the fleet renewal fits in with that?"

One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that we were able to retire many of those old airplanes that you that you referred to. In 2020, on a per seat basis, our total fuel burn was down 6% on a year-over-year basis over 2019. So, that's a big number. And that's a number that we see entering 2021, because a lot of that burn was we received over the course of the latter parts of 2020."

We tripled that in 2020 and that's not due to lower volume, that's just due to the actual seats that we were flying. And I see in 2021 us continuing to make good progress. I can see when we get towards the end of 2021 versus 2019, that number could be as high as 10% that we are -- we've improved our fuel efficiency over this period of time."
1511,en,1,203,1,0.712883,positive,,positive,0.712883,"So, those opportunities are real, every plane that we take on the domestic narrowbody side, whether it's the 220s, the 321s are coming in about 25% more fuel efficient than the plane that we're retiring."

First, I want to thank our 2,000-plus colleagues around the world for delivering strong results for both the quarter and the year. This past year's challenges have forced us all to navigate our daily lives with both grace and grit, and I want to express my sincere appreciation to our Harte Hanks employees who are approached each day with just that. I hope that everyone on this call has similarly managed through the year and could take comfort that we're hopefully nearing the life at the end of the tunnel. We're pleased to announce that we have structured our business into three operating segments: Marketing Services, Customer Care and Fulfillment  Logistics. As will be provided in our 10-K, we've begun segment reporting to reflect this."

I'll highlight our strengthened financial position, the excellent results from our Customer Care business, the progress on our cost reduction efforts, our new executive hires and our optimism around our business going forward. To begin with, first, our strengthened financial position. In 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet and began 2021 with $29.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and we anticipate an additional $7.5 million from an income tax refund by year end."
1561,en,1,509,1,0.873649,positive,,positive,0.86718,"Secondly, our contact center results for the year. Revenue grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5% for the quarter, fueled by continuing project work, increased volume from existing clients and new wins. In 2020, we made significant progress transforming our Customer Care business from a prototypical call center BPO to a tech-first offering, aggregating cross-channel interactions to provide our clients with 360-degree customer profile and leveraging our Harte Hanks CRM marketing services capabilities."

1564,en,1,450,1,0.807103,positive,,positive,0.71184,"Thirdly, our cost reductions. We implemented cost reductions across every aspect of the company, reducing overall costs in 2020 by over $20 million. Our cost cutting was a key contributor to our $1.9 million in positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, our third quarter in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. We reduced our operating expenses in all areas, including labor, production, distribution, advertising and selling, general and G&A expenses."
1565,en,1,393,1,0.830474,positive,,positive,0.798912,"Fourth, new executive hires. To drive growth and momentum, we brought on two new leaders.

We transformed our fulfillment business from a high-touch subscale B2B program focus to full-service B2B and B2C e-commerce fulfillment, powered by a cloud-based WMS and OMS. In Marketing Services, we now sell integrated CRM focused on the entire customer journey and powered by decades of first-party data experience."
1568,en,1,811,1,0.89704,positive,,positive,0.906497,"And lastly, our optimism for growth in 2021. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we believe our businesses are extremely well positioned for a post-COVID world. Our three operating segments participate in large addressable markets that benefit from the e-commerce increase due to behavioral shifts from the pandemic. We're confident that this shift is a lasting trend to continue well beyond the pandemic. We have a unified go-to-market positioning as an omnichannel customer experience company and believe we have a highly differentiated products and service offering. Equally important, we have strong client relationships in high-growth categories such as Financial Services, CPG, Healthcare and B2B tech, with room to grow and with a new leadership team focused on adding value to these relationships and beyond."
1569,en,1,315,1,0.807423,positive,,positive,0.86235,"To conclude, as we enter 2021, we feel confident in our turnaround.

Revenues grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5% for the quarter; this was fueled by continuing project work as well as increased volumes with existing clients. Our Marketing Services business was down a modest 6.3% mostly due to reductions in our clients' 2020 marketing budgets due to COVID. Fulfillment  Logistics was down 39.3% due to the elimination of our mail production facility as well as impacts due to COVID for some clients."

Our cost cutting, coupled with revenue stabilization and growth are key contributors to the positive and consistent adjusted EBITDA. This is the third quarter in a row that we are adjusted EBITDA positive at $1.9 million in Q4. With respect to new business, I am pleased to report that our current weighted pipeline is $14.8 million. Our unweighted pipeline is $41 million, both of which remain strong heading into 2021."

I'd now like to walk through the quarterly results in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues were $47.1 million compared to $52.3 million in the year ago quarter for a year-over-year revenue decline of $5.2 million or 10%. Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $47.4 million, down from $51.9 million in the year ago quarter. We reduced our operating expenses in labor and production and distribution, the decreases were driven from reduction in transportation and facility expenses as well as expenses related to the closure of our mail facilities."

We generated GAAP net income of $1 million or $0.12 and $0.11 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter, respectively. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $3 million or $0.49 per basic and diluted share in the year-ago period.

The cost reductions that we made enabled us to achieve the increase in operating income despite the year-over-year decline in revenue. Customer care had a strong performance for the year with revenue at $58.7 million in 2020 versus $48.4 million in 2019. Operating income was $5.8 million, up from a loss of $4.8 million a year ago.

Our operating expenses for the full year 2020 were $187.5 million compared to $239.2 million in 2019, a decrease of $51.7 million or 21.6%. The $51.7 million decline in operating expenses more than offset the $40.7 million decline in revenues adding to our momentum of improved financial results.

I know you operate in a very difficult environment as many media companies, and you did – you executed very well. I appreciate that. So a couple of questions. Since the company is organized now into three operating segments, can you kind of talk a little bit about how each segment is where there – where most of the revenue is derived from, like in terms of categories like, for instance, maybe you could just talk about the accounts or – what accounts for large portions of the revenues in each one of those segments?"

So our Marketing Services business is essentially a CRM business, a CRM agency that has a few components in it, everything from strategy to creative, to technology to implement e-mail solutions. So when you think about that business and as we think about that business, you would look at competitors within the big holding companies in their CRM pure-play agencies. Our Fulfillment  Logistics business does multiple aspects today of fulfillment, literature fulfillment, product fulfillment, and then we also do trade marketing fulfillment would be the three biggest categories."

So when you look at three components of the business as it stands today, we see growth in product fulfillment, which is obviously what B2B and B2C e-commerce is about. That is e-commerce product fulfillment. And then our Customer Care business, as I mentioned on the call, is transforming, and the majority of the revenue, those are all based on a number of seats with any given client for the services. What I would say is that the transformation that we've made has been to offer more technology services as well. And so we see that business transforming as well over time."

And some of what we thought would be short-term project work that continued into longer than we had planned. But there's still a portion, maybe between 10% and 20%, that what we would consider project work that's not necessarily recurring. But I think that there's still opportunities to continue to grow that and expand in some of that project work that we can continue to do even if its six months to a year-long project rather than a short period."

Certainly, some of our costs normally would fluctuate with the revenue. We're continuing through our restructuring that we expect to complete in 2021. And as you know, we've discussed before, reducing our facilities footprint has certainly been a focus as well as some IT projects we've had going on. We're also embarking on an implementation of a new cloud-based ERP system that we expect to drive additional efficiency in the business and enable us to reduce costs further in the coming years, especially in our overhead-related costs."

Secondly, we've also – and we've discussed this in the past, our goal is to be as asset-light, and that's not just from a real estate footprint standpoint, which we've made tremendous progress over the last few years. But also in terms of technology, as an example. So in our Fulfillment  Logistics business, we're moving towards a much more open architecture, OMS, WMS and reducing our own internal labor for development. So not only are we not reliant going forward on third-party vendors, but we're also not reliant on fixed cost or we won't be as reliant on fixed cost to maintain systems and deliver our work."

1614,en,1,352,1,0.739805,positive,,positive,0.700951,"Yes. So the – as we've talked about, we like to see the weighted pipeline that's weighted at 75% or higher on conversion, likeliness to convert at – tracking at about $15 million. Obviously, the quality of a pipeline is as important as the numbers. Where we feel encouraged is that the quality of what is in there is of higher quality than in the past."
1615,en,1,593,1,0.840416,positive,,positive,0.85931,"So what I mean by that is by design and how we're selling it, our clients and prospects are engaging with more than one service, as an example. So it's a higher quality, higher ticket item, but it's also leveraging more services. So one way to look at it, obviously, is that number. But the other way, which is obviously tougher to see, is the quality. And as we announce more and more client wins and you see the types of client wins, that's another way to see the transition and the work that we're doing, which is towards higher margin, higher ticket item work across all of our businesses."

I know that I'm joining in an interesting time in the retail industry as we continue to face an uncertain macro environment with some lingering questions around when customers will feel more comfortable going out and shopping in stores. That said, I truly believe in the great opportunity we have here at J.Jill. It's what brought me back to the brand after previously serving as Chief Marketing Officer, almost 10 years ago. So while I'm less than 1 month into my new role here, I am well [indiscernible] in what makes J.Jill such a special brand and understand the incredible assets we have to leverage, including our brand equity, our strong omni-channel business model, and our incredibly loyal customer base."

Fiscal year 2020 was a challenging year, and I would like to start today by expressing gratitude to the entire J.Jill team, all of our employees in stores, the distribution center and head offices for the resiliency and tenacity they demonstrated during a time of such great uncertainty. Not only were we focused on navigating the challenging COVID environment, we also took actions to enhance the financial stability of the business, operate more efficiently and position J.Jill for future growth."

We took initial steps to improve the operating model, which we will continue to refine by focusing the product assortment and streamlining the number of product flows and adjusting the marketing mix and spend to maximize returns."

And we executed on our commitment to aggressively manage inventories in fiscal 2020 to provide a clean start to 2021. Looking at the fourth quarter, we continue to see signs of progress. Top line sales of $120 million improved sequentially compared to the third quarter, and each month within the quarter improved sequentially as well. While store traffic continued to trend meaningfully below prior year in the fourth quarter, with enclosed mall stores trailing lifestyle centers, customers that did cross the threshold converted better and responded well to full-priced product."

Gross margin of 57.0% includes 590 basis points related to aggressive action taken in the quarter to liquidate liable markdown products through third parties. Excluding the impact of these liquidations, gross margin was 62.9%, up compared to last year, driven by the strength in full price selling. We continue to focus on operating the business more efficiently. SG&A expenses were down $15 million compared to last year, driven by reductions in store-related selling costs and lower marketing spend."
1651,en,1,808,1,-0.463699,negative,1,negative,-0.402648,"Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with inventories down 20% compared to last year. Total liquidity, as defined in our covenant terms, measured as ending cash balance plus check float and ABL availability was $37.3 million as of the end of the fourth quarter, down compared to third quarter due to the normal cadence of cash usage this time of the year. Regarding tax, the CARES Act passed in March of 2020 permits tax losses to be carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years. We are currently preparing the required filings to obtain refunds by carrying back our current year tax loss and expect to receive a tax refund in excess of $25 million. Consistent with our debt agreements, we expect to apply these $25 million of this refund to pay down the priming term loan by August 30, 2021."
1652,en,1,854,1,0.453068,positive,1,positive,0.387771,"Looking at fiscal 2021, we continue to focus on strengthening the foundation of the business. With visibility still low given the ongoing pandemic, we are not providing guidance at this time. We do, however, expect revenues to continue to recover in the first half as we anniversary temporary store closures related to the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020. We continue to focus on driving gross margin improvement supported by reduced inventory levels and better full price selling. Capital investment will increase to approximately $10 million, driven by a return to normalized capital maintenance levels and select investments in customer experience enhancing initiatives. And though we believe the store channel is a very important channel for J.Jill, we will continue to evaluate store performance post-pandemic and expect to close about 20 stores in 2021."

Salarius also filed a 10-K this afternoon, which is available on Salariuspharma.com and sec.gov. Before beginning today's call, I would like to make the following statement. Today, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements about future expectations, plans, events and circumstances including statements about our strategy, future operations and the development of our lead investigational drug candidate, seclidemstat, and our expectations regarding our capital allocation and cash resources. These statements are based on our current expectations, and you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Actual results may differ materially due to our risks and uncertainties and including those detailed in the Risk Factors section of Salarius Pharmaceuticals 10-K filed with the SEC and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time."

Today's call highlights an exciting time in the growth of Salarius. In just the past few weeks, we have achieved important clinical milestones in the development of our lead drug candidate, seclidemstat, and we have achieved significant milestones in financing Salarius."
1684,en,1,599,1,0.455722,positive,,positive,0.455722,"We have completed the dose escalation portion of the ewing sarcoma clinical trial and seclidemstat is now being investigated at the recommended Phase II dose in three distinct patient populations made up of viewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcomas, which, in the case of viewing-related sarcomas, include two patient populations made up of myxoid liposarcoma and other FET-translocated sarcomas. Each of these three patient groups, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma and FET-translocated sarcomas potentially represents a separate regulatory path to approval and the related commercial opportunity."
1685,en,1,433,1,0.76195,positive,,positive,0.74514,"These recent clinical milestones and the expansion of the viewing clinical trial to include Ewing's related sarcomas, further underpins and supports the first prong of our development strategy, speed to market. Salarius is now investigating three patient populations, each of which is supported by future clinical results, we believe has the potential for accelerated regulatory approval and supports our strategy of speed to market."
1686,en,1,455,1,0.910931,positive,,positive,0.9368,"In parallel, I'm very pleased to report that as a result of a series of financial transactions, Salarius now has the capital resources of approximately $37 million in available cash to fund our current clinical trials, while providing the ability to develop seclidemstat in larger market indications, including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. These larger market indications represent the second prong of our development strategy, expand the market."
1687,en,1,250,1,0.507775,positive,,positive,0.507775,"In addition to these clinical and financial achievements, we have also amended the Ewing clinical trial to expand the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population and improve patient access to seclidemstat earlier in the patient's treatment paradigm."
1688,en,1,304,1,0.755072,positive,,positive,0.755072,"By combining seclidemstat with the common second or third-line chemotherapy treatment, topotecan and cyclophosphamide, we hope to open the door to seclidemstat's potential use much earlier in a Ewing patient's treatment continuum as a second or third-line therapy, while improving their patient outcomes."
1689,en,1,274,1,0.705295,positive,,positive,0.70701,"Let me make sure I clearly communicated the importance of these developments. We believe we have integrated seclidemstat into the Ewing sarcoma standard of care, and seclidemstat can now be easily administered as a second or third-line therapy in our ongoing clinical trial."
1690,en,1,261,1,0.887096,positive,,positive,0.887096,"In addition to increasing the number of patients who can receive seclidemstat treatment, we believe that this also makes it easier for physicians to utilize seclidemstat early in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care, while potentially improving patient outcomes."
1691,en,1,607,1,0.638627,positive,,positive,0.638627,"Finally, in a small subset of Ewing-related sarcoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease, that enrolled in the advanced solid tumor trial, all patients in the subset showed indications of seclidemstat drug activity as evidenced by a medium time to progression that was greater or longer than a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. It is important to note that these indications of drug activity occurred at doses below the recommended Phase II dose that we are currently using in our ongoing Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trials."
1692,en,1,290,1,0.27745,positive,,positive,0.27745,"Again, to be clear, in a small subset of patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing-related sarcoma, we observed a median increase in the patient's time to progression when compared to a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in the advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting."
1693,en,1,406,1,0.563024,positive,1,positive,0.546346,"We believe this is exciting preliminary data of seclidemstat activity in Ewing-related sarcomas. I cannot understate our view regarding the importance of these developments to the ongoing growth of seclidemstat and Salarius, nor can I understate how well we believe this positions Salarius for the future. Mark and I look forward to speaking in detail about each of these accomplishments later in the call."
1694,en,1,398,1,0.87272,positive,,positive,0.848474,"However, before that, I would like to take a moment and provide my thoughts on the past 12 months. If you had asked me a year ago, if Salarius would be in the position of strength that we are now in, I would have responded with a resounding, absolutely. Why would I have said that? Because we had a well-defined strategy, and we executed on a plan that I fully expected will yield positive results."
1695,en,1,340,1,-0.441553,negative,1,negative,-0.377698,"Of course, this plan did not factor in the COVID-19 pandemic. In just a matter of days last March, the world was impacted by a once-in-a-generation situation. Salarius was not immune. But in spite of the many uncertainties, we were able to quickly make adjustments that enabled us to persevere in certain ways, become stronger as a company."
1696,en,1,380,1,0.821754,positive,,positive,0.821754,"This type of fortitude was especially evident in those who led and participated in our clinical trials, including our clinical development team, the investigators and staff at our cancer centers that are implementing our clinical trials and most importantly, the trial participants and their families who selflessly volunteered their time and energy despite these many challenges."
1697,en,1,315,1,0.715406,positive,,positive,0.794151,"For the patients with advanced cancers participating in our clinical trials, everyday activity suddenly became an even greater ordeal. Yet these patients were willing to participate in our trials, so that we could continue developing seclidemstat to all the past and current participants in our trial, we thank you."
1698,en,1,262,1,0.867088,positive,,positive,0.867088,"Later in today's discussion, I'll talk more about the positive impact of our recent clinical and financial milestone achievements and our plans to continuing developing seclidemstat for larger market indications, including solid tumors and hematological cancers."
1699,en,1,188,1,0.638977,positive,,positive,0.845446,"But now I would like to hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rosenblum, who will speak to our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. Mark, please go ahead."

1701,en,1,242,1,0.538939,positive,1,positive,0.524067,"Thank you, David. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, Salarius reported a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.9 million and $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009."
1702,en,1,584,1,-0.767609,negative,,negative,-0.778466,"For the full-year, Salarius reported a net loss of $7.4 million and $0.50 per basic and diluted share versus a loss of $6.9 million, or $2.12 per basic and diluted share for the prior year. The loss from operations before other income for the three months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $0.3 million compared to the loss from operations of overall $2.1 million for the same time spend last year, which was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in grant revenue and lower general and administrative costs, more than offsetting higher research and development expenditures."
1703,en,1,641,1,0.620153,positive,,neutral,0.0,"Increased research and development costs resulted from increased drug manufacturing costs. The decrease in general and administrative costs resulted from the absence of expenses related to Salarius' onetime transformation into a public company during 2019, which did not reoccur in the current period. This offsets higher personnel costs in the current period. Our December 31 balance sheet states the company had $11.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The balance sheet was strengthened in early 2021 as the company raised over $30 million from both the sale of our common stock and underwritten public offering and warrants exercises."
1704,en,1,359,1,0.884156,positive,,positive,0.805571,"We also received $0.9 million in non-dilutive secret financing during Q1 2021. Salarius has an additional $4.8 million under the secret Grant, and we expect to receive a portion of that amount in 2021. The results of these funding activities is that Salarius has currently available cash of approximately $37 million, our strongest financial position to date."
1705,en,1,127,1,0.77754,positive,,positive,0.77754,We believe Salarius has the financial resources available to advance our ongoing clinical trials through completion and beyond.

1708,en,1,487,1,0.926372,positive,,positive,0.926876,"Thank you, Mark. As we have discussed, our goal as a company is to maximize the potential of seclidemstat, and by doing so, bring hope to patients and their families facing limited treatment options, while creating and building shareholder value. To that end, I would like to state that by midyear 2021 this year, we hope to have active clinical trials across 5 separate patient populations, evaluating seclidemstat as single-agent therapy and in up to 3 different combination therapies."
1709,en,1,596,1,0.823269,positive,,positive,0.808613,"As discussed earlier, completing the dose escalation stage of our Ewing sarcoma clinical trial is a major achievement. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of seclidemstat with secondary endpoints to assess the maximum tolerated dose, determine the recommended Phase II dose and measure antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. I am pleased to report that the dose escalation stage succeeded. Data demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile. The recommended Phase II dose for the expansion stage has been established."
1710,en,1,468,1,0.79789,positive,,positive,0.817835,"And importantly, pharmacokinetic data indicated that treatment at the recommended Phase II dose achieved human plasma concentrations above levels where seclidemstat demonstrated activity in preclinical or animal studies. We believe the data from this dose escalation trial is compelling. And for this reason, Salarius has submitted the full findings, including details on safety, dosing and initial efficacy signals for presentation at an upcoming oncology conference."
1711,en,1,378,1,0.453094,positive,,positive,0.884823,"Once the conference embargo lifts, we will be able to provide more detailed information. Again, please allow me to reiterate because it is important to state clearly. The dose escalation stage of the trial achieved all key endpoints. It demonstrated seclidemstat safety profile established a recommended Phase II dose, and we believe it provided early evidence of drug activity."
1712,en,1,498,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Although our dose escalation trial is primarily focused on establishing seclidemstat's safety, we believe, as we've stated, we observed preliminary evidence supporting seclidemstat's potential to treat advanced-stage cancer patients. Notably, these observations occurred in patients primarily treated at doses below the recommended Phase II dose in patients that were heavily pretreated with multiple prior treatment failures, and in patients who had relapsed or refractory disease upon enrollment."
1713,en,1,504,1,-0.604115,negative,,negative,-0.5521,"This preliminary evidence of drug activity was observed in a refractory Ewing sarcoma patient who is treated with single-agent seclidemstat for 6 28-day cycles and demonstrated more than a 75% tumor reduction in prospectively defined some of target lesions. However, despite this significant tumor reduction, a new non-target lesion appeared at the end of cycle 2, resulting in a classification of progressive disease as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, version 1.1 or RECIST 1.1."
1714,en,1,712,1,0.39314,positive,1,positive,0.427877,"Having said that, Salarius believes this data demonstrates preliminary single agent drug activity in a patient with refractory Ewing sarcoma, meaning disease, which had failed prior medical treatments responded to seclidemstat as single-agent therapy. This is especially encouraging, given the challenge in treating refractory disease and the fact that the patient received no other cancer treatment while taking seclude stat. Given the preliminary evidence of drug activity observed, Salarius believes there is a meaningful opportunity to introduce seclidemstat earlier in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care, which we believe will benefit patients and increase the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population."
1715,en,1,334,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Internal preclinical research suggests that Ewing sarcoma cell lines, seclidemstat has an additive effect, an additive effect when combined with the chemotherapy agents, topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This suggests the seclidemstat can be added to topotecan and cyclophosphamide and potentially improve upon current patient outcomes."
1716,en,1,284,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Additionally, because topotecan and cyclophosphamide de are commonly used as second or third-line treatment. Salarius can potentially increase the addressable patient population for seclidemstat by supporting doctors and patients use of seclidemstat earlier in the treatment paradigm."
1717,en,1,484,1,0.998595,positive,,positive,0.998595,"Based on these conditions, Salarius considerations, Salarius amended the dose expansion trial protocol so that Ewing sarcoma patients who have failed 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy may be treated with seclidemstat in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide as second or third-line therapy. This is an exciting development and one that aligns perfectly with our goal to increase our use of seclidemstat by exploring its potential as a treatment for a broader patient population."
1718,en,1,197,1,0.712776,positive,,positive,0.712776,"In addition to the Ewing sarcoma news, we believe we have seen encouraging clinical data from a small subset of viewing related sarcoma patients enrolled in the Salarius advanced solid tumor trial."
1719,en,1,803,1,0.554028,positive,1,positive,0.561812,"All patients in this subgroup had relapsed or refractory disease when enrolled in the trial, and all patients in this subset demonstrated signs of drug activity despite being treated with seclidemstat at doses below the recommended Phase II dose. Patients in this subgroup exhibited a median time to progression longer than a commonly-used benchmark for assessing single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. This is exactly -- and I want to repeat, this is exactly the type of data we were hoping to see to support seclidemstat's potential to treat these difficult viewing Ewing-related sarcomas and move forward with our strategy to expand in new patient populations, establish new potential paths to regulatory approval and pursue the related commercial opportunities."
1720,en,1,676,1,0.708987,positive,,positive,0.708987,"Salarius has now initiated the dose expansion stage of the Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trial, which was expanded to include up to 30 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma as well as up to 30 patients with sarcomas that share a similar biology to Ewing sarcoma. I've referred to these as Ewing-related sarcomas or FET translocated sarcomas. These Ewing-related sarcoma patients or patients with myxoid liposarcoma and other FET translocated sarcomas will continue to be treated with single-agent seclidemstaat and represent completely new addressable patient populations, each with the potential path regulatory approval and a potential commercial opportunity."
1721,en,1,213,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,The dose expansion portion of the Ewing and Ewing-related trial will continue to evaluate safety and antitumor activity in all participants with preliminary data readouts expected towards the end of 2021 and 2022.
1722,en,1,273,1,0.753539,positive,,positive,0.731633,"Salarius has also submitted findings from the advanced solid tumor trial, including details on safety, dosing and initial safety signals for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Once the conference embargo lifts, we will be able to provide even more information."
1723,en,1,358,1,0.972867,positive,,positive,0.972867,"In summary, we believe the clinical data collected thus far from the Ewing sarcoma trial and the ongoing advanced solid tumor trial has demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile, can be administered at doses that are clinically relevant, and we believe has provided evidence of drug activity in patient populations with advanced disease."
1724,en,1,232,1,0.909131,positive,,positive,0.909131,We believe that the clinical progress discussed today paints a promising picture of seclidemstat's potential as both a single agent and combination therapy for patients with hard-to-treat cancers in need of better treatment options.
1725,en,1,228,1,0.841893,positive,,positive,0.841893,Salarius and our clinical investigators are excited about the potential of seclidemstat to treat Ewing sarcoma patients earlier and the potential to treat these additional Ewing sarcoma patient -- Ewing-related sarcoma patients.
1726,en,1,464,1,0.522578,positive,1,positive,0.526909,"In addition -- and additionally, we believe there is a substantial unexplored potential ahead for seclidemstat, and we anticipate even more opportunities in 2021 to justify the use of seclidemstat in other underserved cancers. In that regard, Salarius has completed much of the necessary work to begin clinical trials in other cancer indications that align with seclidemstat's mechanism of action, and we look forward to announcing these trials in the near future."
1727,en,1,392,1,-0.567389,negative,,negative,-0.784796,"Areas of interest we have previously discussed include hematologic cancers and the use of seclidemstat in combination with immuno-oncology therapies, specifically checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapy treatment designed to unleash a human immune system attack on cancer cells. However, these drugs do not work in all cancer patients or in all cancer types."
1728,en,1,630,1,-0.26805,negative,1,positive,0.308028,"In addition, patients do not show an initial -- in addition, patients that do show an initial response can become resistant to the checkpoint inhibitor treatment and experience a return of the disease, commonly known as disease relapse. Interestingly, data from preclinical studies conducted by the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, and published in the peer review journal plus 1 last year demonstrated the potential of using seclidemstat in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to overcome cancer's ability to hide from the immune system and thereby unleash the immune system to attack the cancer."
1729,en,1,189,1,-0.486031,negative,,negative,-0.486031,"In simple terms, seclidemstat may turn tumors concealed from a patient's immune system called cold tumors, into hot tumors, our tumors, the immune system is able to identify and infiltrate."
1730,en,1,507,1,0.614917,positive,,positive,0.621372,"These now hot tumors could then respond to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. This provides a significant opportunity for seclidemstat because it could be used to treat patients with a wide variety of cancers that are currently unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors. As I said earlier, considering the data we have generated to date and the potential for additional data generation in ongoing clinical programs and soon to be announced additional clinical programs, these are exciting times for Salarius."

So I just wanted to go back to Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcoma trial. So you have a combo with chemotherapy in second and third-line, and then you have a single agent for Ewing-related sarcomas in the third-line. So why did you decide not to combine Ewing-related sarcomas with chemo, just like you did with Ewing sarcoma itself?"

1775,en,1,290,1,0.611034,positive,1,positive,0.55304,"Yes, sure. It's a very valid question. So for the myxoid liposarcoma, there is -- there are two drugs that are currently approved. What we have observed in these patients as a single agent that those patients have failed those standard treatment and still had significant clinical activity."
1776,en,1,391,1,0.521478,positive,1,positive,0.486352,"So we want to further establish single-agent activity for the myxoid liposarcoma. And if we are able to show what we observed in the preliminary, I think, it will be a relatively a good path to regulatory approval as a single agent. We do have some internal discussions have been going on. So we are looking at further combinations as well, but we're not ready to disclose them at this time."
1777,en,1,302,1,-0.470151,negative,1,positive,0.250423,"Regarding the FET translocation to sarcoma, there is no standard treatment for those patients.

So it will be difficult to select a single or a couple of chemotherapy regimens that one would want to combine with."

Where does -- can you remind us what the standard of care stands for those 2 kind of groups of patients? Second, third-line in sarcoma and kind of third-line plus Ewing-related sarcoma.

The benchmark is around 5 to 6 months median PFS. For myxoid liposarcoma, in earlier lines of patients, now I remember, we have patients that have failed with standard treatment but in myxoid liposarcoma, the range of median PFS is around 3.5 to 4 months. That's the median PFS."

And based off the signal mentioned by David and Nadeem, is why we're now expanding the Ewing sarcoma trial to include these additional patients. So already, the FET solid tumor trial has given us an indication of patients that may respond better to seclidemstat."

About the -- you mentioned the additive effect of chemotherapy and are you planning to share that data? Are you planning to publish that data? And if there is additional -- there is additive effect to chemotherapy, why wouldn't you try all the trials with chemotherapy instead of trying -- as a single agent?"

1801,en,1,514,1,0.487336,positive,1,positive,0.509929,"Yes, happy to. So we have done in vitro experiments, combining the chemo regimen, topotecan and cyclophosphamide with seclidemstat and seen additivity. The mechanism there is topotecan and cyclophosphamide or DNA damage agents and LSD1 has been implicated as well in the DNA damage response. And it may also expose more DNA through its chromatin reconfiguration to the effects of DNA damage and agents. So we feel quite strongly about combining with topotecan and cyclophosphamide from a mechanistic point of view."
1802,en,1,243,1,0.480466,positive,,positive,0.480466,"But then also importantly, our safety profile does not have significant overlapping toxicity concerns with the chemo regimen, which means that moving forward in clinic, that's a good strategy as you don't have those overlapping talks concerns."
1803,en,1,167,1,-0.526225,negative,,negative,-0.526225,And I'll let David mention why we're taking the strategy of continuing to pursue single agent and some of the other Ewing-related sarcomas before combining with chemo?

1805,en,1,672,1,0.721241,positive,1,positive,0.712447,"So Aydin, thanks for the question. The short answer is we have not taken anything off the table. We're going to follow the science and always try and do what's in the best interest of achieving the most positive in outcomes. So where we are now with the myxoid Ewing-related sarcomas, is we're following the results that we observed in the subset of patients. And we're fortifying those results with greater patient numbers. And by continuing in single agent therapy, as Nadeem mentioned earlier, if we see results that we're hoping to see, we could have potentially both a single agent and a combination therapy approach to treating those types of Ewing-related sarcomas."
1806,en,1,475,1,0.789084,positive,,positive,0.817747,"While this is going on, our -- we're working here in our lab internally to identify what chemotherapy agents might be the best combination choices should we decide and head that direction. So looking back to my how I started the answer to the question, we're keeping all options on the table. But right now, we like the fact that we're pursuing single agent therapy and see where that takes us, which sets up the option of having in a number of directions in the near future."

My question relates to what do you view as the potential of seclidemstat in hematological malignancies? And what that is sort of driving that?"

1814,en,1,326,1,0.691158,positive,1,positive,0.703408,"Yes, happy to. Thanks for the question, Hunter. So LSD1 as a target has been well-validated for hem malignancies due to LSD1's role in blocking differentiation and then driving malignant cell growth. And we've seen other companies with LSD1 inhibitors showing clinical proof-of-concept in hem indications, specifically in AML."
1815,en,1,524,1,0.51398,positive,1,positive,0.568516,"At Salarius, what we've done is we studied seclidemstat in a variety of heme malignancies, AML, myelodysplastic syndrome. And we've seen that seclidemstat has an antiproliferative effect and also that it shows synergistic effects when combined with a commonly used agent in the space, azacitidine. And then as we mentioned before, one of the benefits of seclidemstat is that we have a manageable safety profile, and we have not seen significant heme talks that some of these other LSD1 inhibitors will often face in clinics."
1816,en,1,363,1,0.951959,positive,,positive,0.933448,"So we think the combination of our activity in the preclinical model, coupled with our advantage in terms of more manageable heme safety profile will give us an advantage in pursuing seclidemstat within the hematological malignancy indication.

The answer is, I'm constantly looking at all areas that will first support the development of seclidemstat and ensure that we are maximizing its potential for patients and ultimately, shareholders. We're -- we want to do is best for patients and create value for shareholders. Now having said that, we're approached constantly by other organizations that have seen our ability to develop assets and advance them.

In total fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%. These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips on average they are spending more with us compared to last year."

Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless, we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year."
1895,en,1,963,1,0.829742,positive,,positive,0.737576,"As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from non-consumable categories, and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by, increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees."
1896,en,1,517,1,0.470433,positive,,negative,-0.377841,"SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees, and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail, labor and depreciation and amortization."
1897,en,1,636,1,0.796695,positive,,positive,0.818146,"Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million. As a percent of sales operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million, or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees, and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers."
1898,en,1,254,1,0.828956,positive,,positive,0.852286,"Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year.

We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can based on what we currently know."

1906,en,1,585,1,0.430839,positive,,positive,0.624298,"With this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021. Net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat, a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6%, but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a two-year stack basis, and EPS in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20%, or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a two-year period which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%."

With regards to shareholder returns, as outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.42 per share, which represents an increase of 16.7%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Finally, as noted in today's press release, our outlook for 2021, real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q3 earnings release on December 3, 2020."

Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. Despite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February, increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a two-year stack basis. From the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16%, as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%."

That said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1."
1910,en,1,512,1,-0.550811,negative,1,negative,-0.527633,"Turning to gross margin. In 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin non-consumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories, well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate. However, the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain."

In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020, which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year."

Also, please keep in mind, that the second and third quarters, represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2, 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3, 2020."

However, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives, as we further the rollouts."
1914,en,1,528,1,0.636013,positive,1,positive,0.644084,"With regard to our strategic initiatives, in aggregate, we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. Finally, we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February."
1915,en,1,545,1,0.981387,positive,,positive,0.977393,"In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results.

1964,en,1,492,1,0.597541,positive,1,positive,0.585995,"Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it looks like you're guiding to about 60 basis points of operating margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. Why wouldn't it be more than that? Given you're comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a two-year stack basis plus you're benefiting from all these margin-enhancing initiatives like DG Fresh, Fast Track, NCI and others. And how -- within that, how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus 2019?"
1965,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
1966,en,1,399,1,0.549317,positive,1,positive,0.502785,"Yes. So I'll tackle both those questions, Michael. This is John. First of all, I'd say, we're really pleased with what we did in 2020, expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didn't give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds, the biggest headwind being the SG&A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year."
1967,en,1,340,1,0.692118,positive,,positive,0.578006,"We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables, which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall."
1968,en,1,390,1,0.874425,positive,,positive,0.899852,"Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin, again, we feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that 117 basis points for the year. And to your point initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out."
1969,en,1,695,1,0.782383,positive,,positive,0.859232,"The three biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns, higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. But we also as I mentioned are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So, as we look ahead in the near term, these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer-term, we do feel like we're well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned, the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we've talked about before within gross margin and within SG&A."
1970,en,1,666,1,0.776664,positive,,positive,0.806428,"But at the same time, it's noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10% double-digit EPS growers over the long-term, we are continuing as we called out to reinvest in the business. We mentioned $60 million to $70 million that's hitting SG&A next year. And then the other thing I'll mention is in terms of COVID expenses, we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we've captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers."

1972,en,1,573,1,0.284414,positive,1,negative,-0.275424,"Understood. That's very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And we're all just trying to figure out what's going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down 16% versus the 34.5% in March of last year, it would imply a high teens two-year stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year? Have you -- are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens two-year stack would be, kind of, a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months?"

And then in March, you're extrapolating over a very short period of time, which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here, we called out, yes, as you mentioned the negative 16% month-to-date from the end of February through March 16th this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year, it was not dissimilar to the 34.5% comp where we ended the period, so fairly representative. But again there's a fair bit of noise within this, so I'd be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully that helps you understand where we were at this point."

1980,en,1,616,1,0.557008,positive,1,positive,0.564285,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, I guess, first on the comps. The 10% to 12% that you mentioned in the release on a two-year stack, it actually felt like that's a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so -- yet you're still going to have stimulus at least in the first part of the year probably now and for a little while longer. And so, I guess, the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that? Any thoughts around it, why -- if the 10% to 12% in our view is doable, why couldn't the top-line end up being a little bit stronger?"
1981,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
1982,en,1,349,1,0.78327,positive,,positive,0.731441,"Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again just dialing the clock back a little bit, we've said historically that this model works really well at a 2% to 4% comp. That's the engine of the 10%-plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a two-year comp stack of 10% to 12% over two years that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that."
1983,en,1,340,1,0.848203,positive,,positive,0.869347,"And I tell you we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said, the relevance of the brand, the broadening appeal, the new customers we've brought in, the bigger baskets we're enjoying I'd say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted, the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance."
1984,en,1,666,1,0.689268,positive,,positive,0.676438,"So we feel good about the guidance that we've provided. But we did note that -- and it's based on what we know, but what we did note was that we didn't include the impact of stimulus. because it's really relatively unknown what impact it will have to what degree it might help. So that's not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there's just a lot of uncertainty when you think about; one, compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain."
1985,en,1,409,1,0.357082,positive,1,positive,0.35265,"And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times what people say and do is two different things and so it remains to be seen if that's the case. So we're cautiously optimistic. We didn't build it in. It could be an upside, but it's just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree."

1987,en,1,259,1,0.508451,positive,1,positive,0.448898,"Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up and maybe take another shot at something Michael just asked. If you look at the gross margins versus 2019 and John you mentioned some transportation costs, is there any reason why they shouldn't be higher than 2019?"

1990,en,1,573,1,0.769263,positive,,positive,0.632153,"I'll just say that we're really pleased with the performance we've been delivering over the last few years, growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over two points this year. But again there's a lot of unknown this year, a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned, when you look at this year that does create some deleverage. And again, we are investing in the business. Now again that investment piece is accretive, but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates and then obviously, you do have other inflationary pressures."

1997,en,1,400,1,0.529425,positive,,positive,0.529425,"And then on the double-digit two-year stack that you forecasted for this year, how much of the acceleration relative to the past two years do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains? Trying to get a sense for that two-year stack of double-digits relative to mid-to-high single digits the trailing two years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable?"

1999,en,1,445,1,0.837916,positive,,positive,0.848387,"Yes. This is Todd. Yes, I would tell you let me take the second part first. I would tell you that that comp we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is we've seen them continue to come back so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into 2021. We see them still here in 2021, which is really good to see."
2000,en,1,359,1,0.625217,positive,,positive,0.705305,"And again with all of our initiatives, Matt, that we've got put together I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I'm not going to give you exactly what you're looking for, but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here."
2001,en,1,568,1,-0.297705,negative,1,positive,0.290541,"And then what we've seen so far just to give you a little bit more color non-consumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March, it will become even more meaningful because as you recall the stock-up trip from last year with the pandemic with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable food, perishable areas really took off last year and non-consumables were a little soft quite frankly. And we're seeing the opposite quite frankly right now. So that's great to see."
2002,en,1,313,1,0.891034,positive,,positive,0.896655,But what we can also see is that our initiatives around non-consumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those non-consumables in them as well. So they're spending at a good rate there and we believe that she'll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year.

2004,en,1,361,1,0.780793,positive,,positive,0.773713,"Great. And then maybe just to follow up John on the SG&A front. Could you just help quantify what you've embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective just so we can baseline it? And then ex the strategic investments, is there any change to 2.5% to 3%? I think that's roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that?"
2005,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,John Garratt
2006,en,1,574,1,0.688811,positive,,positive,0.787134,"Yes. I'll tackle both of those. First in terms of the COVID spend, obviously, we're going to do what's necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That's of course going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say we've built in a considerable reduction of that assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that's what's captured in the guidance. We didn't give a specific number on that, but it is a considerable step down."
2007,en,1,515,1,0.694405,positive,1,positive,0.696487,"As you think about SG&A and the 2.5% to 3% leverage point, we've kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One we are investing in SG&A to drive overall operating margin expansion particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh as we're taking over self-distribution, NCI you spend a little bit on SG&A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin, so it's very beneficial overall. But it does throw off the math on that."
2008,en,1,586,1,0.322842,positive,1,negative,-0.268262,"And then there are some other initiatives like pOpshelf and others that are more --have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we've done is we've really stepped up the remodels and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out that's a lot to strip out that as well as the COVID expenses, yes we're still looking at that 2.5% to 3% leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. But that's really the only change to that."
2009,en,1,311,1,0.737185,positive,,positive,0.666765,But for the next few years as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores for instance and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That's really the big driver there. But overall it's accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective.

But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So, if we were to basically dollarize your comps for lack of a better term, it looks like there really wasn't much of a change in your sales run rate like from a sales per store perspective between March -- February and March."
2018,en,1,379,1,0.973407,positive,,positive,0.973407,"So, two questions; first is that a fair assumption?

As you look at the guidance we provided this year, we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we've put in place like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries."
2021,en,1,348,1,0.376891,positive,1,positive,0.577703,"So, we've assumed a pretty considerable retention of that.

So, when you strip out all the noise, I would tell you that again with the guidance we provided that contemplates what we've seen up to this point.

2033,en,1,408,1,0.666614,positive,1,positive,0.663713,"Hi thanks very much. I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar 2021? I mean obviously you saw a pretty meaningful I think deceleration in traffic in February but that's off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year. So, wondering if you could talk a little bit about that just broadly."
2034,en,1,455,1,-0.527611,negative,,negative,-0.586552,"And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about '22 as it relates to gross margins. So, the question I have on that is how should we think about the base level of gross margin for 2022? Because it seems like you are at a much more permanently elevated base on the gross margin front. And I know 2021 is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts, but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to 2022 on the gross margin front."

2036,en,1,685,1,-0.38951,negative,1,negative,-0.463892,"Thanks for the question Karen. I'll take the first part and then kick it over to John for the 2022 gross margin discussion. So, on the traffic side, again, February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that quite frankly we -- you saw in the release 8,500 store hours of lost time, but the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost two days, we had anywhere from 20% to 30% of our store base close for that time. So, it's a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what's happened in March. But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4."
2037,en,1,394,1,0.262069,positive,1,positive,0.280171,"As John said, as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes, I think it's important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure we've seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again, I caution it's still very early to tell what's going to happen here."
2038,en,1,395,1,0.382903,positive,,positive,0.484689,"But I think the bigger picture is we're retaining a lot of those customers as I mentioned earlier that we got during the pandemic. And we're still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new non-consumable type items that we've got in our stores, she still comes to us."
2039,en,1,236,1,0.748733,positive,,positive,0.685229,"So, we believe we're seeing that repeat customer. And there's no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John?"

I think one thing, I would point to as you look at over that two year period lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line a two year CAGR of 15% to 20% I think really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line, and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future."
2042,en,1,398,1,0.411851,positive,,positive,0.695548,"Now, I don't want to give specific guidance around 2022. It's premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4, and for the full year, as I mentioned, it's the strategic initiatives, which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we're reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin."
2043,en,1,891,1,0.610529,positive,1,negative,-0.272716,"Now the one thing that we mentioned just – 2020 a little bit was the mix, so that's why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat, which is a bit of a drag. But the thing – the other items driving that gross margin expansion we expect to continue. And so that's why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year, and would encourage people to look at that two year stack and push forward the same drivers are there that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term, not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones, but really pleased what we've seen with the shrink improvement, the supply chain efficiencies, a lot of opportunities still around private brands, penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management."
2044,en,1,600,1,0.774497,positive,,positive,0.779369,"Again, when you look at our scale and our growing scale, as a limited SKU shop it really puts us in a very favorable position, to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front, we'll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now, and as we've seen for quite a while now, we feel like we're in the best position on pricing we've been in, and don't see at least the foreseeable future the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin, while also driving traffic and sales."

Karen, I would also just – just say real quick, and then get to the next question is that, I feel as good about this business than I have the 12 almost 13 years that I've been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated, I think once we get through the noise of 2021, I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen even prior to COVID, we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there's no reason why that shouldn't continue as we can – as we go long term."

So if you look at, the overall dollars, we quantified about half of that was sales flow through. So maybe that's the way to dimensionalize that."

I was curious, what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative, I was just curious, if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately?"

2058,en,1,337,1,0.890786,positive,,positive,0.893652,"Yeah. As you look at the promotional backdrop, we think it remains rational. It's been that way for the last about a year and half, so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward, we're not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we're very well positioned on price. And Todd, do you want to add anything?"

And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing, we are better than we've been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated, the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame, and quite frankly has been that way for a year and half. So we feel pretty good about where we are, but always reserve the right, if we need to help our consumer out we'll do that. But right now, we don't see that in the near future."

So Todd just curious on your latest thoughts on, what you're seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us, I mean, it is a fairly strong consumer out there stimulus is coming. So, I just want to get your thoughts there?"
2063,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Todd Vasos
2064,en,1,545,1,-0.553227,negative,1,negative,-0.738774,"Yeah. I would tell you the consumer – our core consumers always stretch as you know, but I have to repeat that each time, because she really is. And I would tell you that, in the last six to eight months, she's felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases, because again lack of work, or not working that full 40-hour shift to that full-time that, she was doing in many cases. So and our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point."
2065,en,1,124,1,0.966329,positive,,positive,0.96827,"In saying that, what we have also seen though is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that."
2066,en,1,422,1,0.922616,positive,,positive,0.918514,"So we're in round three and as I indicated, it's very early on in that third round. We're bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we're also bullish, when we think about the back half of the year, the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December, should also benefit our core consumer. And then, obviously, the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps."
2067,en,1,332,1,0.793692,positive,,positive,0.787936,"So there is a lot of tailwind. We just, in our guidance, didn't contemplate any of that, because again it's so -- first of all, it's so new, we just don't know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing, Rupesh, to keep in mind is that we're well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she's outspending it."
2068,en,1,425,1,0.848169,positive,,positive,0.827398,"And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said, there are other -- we're not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get more than our fair share at retail. It's just some of these other areas that are now open, whether it be dining out, whether it be travel to some degree that will be competed against.

And I would tell you, first of all, our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the pOpshelf consumer. But in the areas that we're looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts, it is a little higher demographic than our core."
2080,en,1,338,1,0.407762,positive,1,positive,0.426798,"So just to give you some color, in these areas, the demographics are more in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range versus our true Dollar General of $35,000 to $40,000 range, somewhere in there. So it's not quite the pOpshelf where it's $75,000-plus. But I believe that the crossover, there's enough there to entice the consumer to come in."
2081,en,1,278,1,0.494,positive,,positive,0.494,"The second piece of it is that, we believe that -- and we've already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in pOpshelf and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General, without even having any signage up with pOpshelf."
2082,en,1,214,1,0.884267,positive,,positive,0.896676,"So, we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation, higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box."

We thought it was the right time to start launching it, because we knew, because of the way we were doing it, this wasn't a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane, we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set."

Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor section of our website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website."

During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year 2021 net revenue, earnings and cash flows. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."

2147,en,1,246,1,0.921931,positive,,positive,0.922056,"Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by offering a warm thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for your commitment and thank you for always making safety your top priority."
2148,en,1,830,1,0.700678,positive,1,positive,0.72369,"And stepping back and reflecting for a moment, it's hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID. I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago, here in our March 2020 earnings call, when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild. Yet in typical Jabil fashion, our people did what they do; they dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic. They did so by looking after one another, while taking outstanding care of our customers. It's a point in time that I'll never forget; it's a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil. Their attitude and their actions continue to impress. And for sure, there is no other team I'd rather be part of. Again, much thanks to all of our employees who simply make Jabil, Jabil."
2149,en,1,915,1,0.887052,positive,,positive,0.816628,"Please turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at our 2Q results. Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected product demand, solid execution and a well-balanced contribution throughout the entire company. The team delivered core earnings per share of $1.27 on revenue of $6.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%. I'm really pleased with our financial results for the quarter. Although, what's quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '21. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around our second quarter results during his prepared remarks."
2150,en,1,638,1,0.82381,positive,,positive,0.802205,"I'd now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate. Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient; this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand. Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers. It's a proven formula that's trusted by many of the world's most remarkable brands."
2151,en,1,1114,1,0.93109,positive,,positive,0.928779,"Moving to Slide 7, I'll address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of $5 a share, an increase of 25% from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around $28.5 billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10 basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be 4.2% for the year. Lastly, we remain committed to generating a minimum of $600 million in free cash flow, a testament to how we're managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook, it's notable that our strategy is working, our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point, when we think about the how, we think about purpose; a purpose that guides us in our journey, a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors; behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world. I'm just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas."
2152,en,1,933,1,0.776046,positive,1,positive,0.811353,"As we transition to my final slide, I want to once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two years to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets; markets that largely align with secular trends. A few examples of these being 5G, personalized healthcare, electric vehicles, digital learning, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. Our team continues to develop deep domain expertise in concert with these secular tailwinds. I like the decisions we're making and what we're doing, and we do what we do while respecting the environment and safeguarding our workplace. We're committed to a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance. We encourage each and every employee here at Jabil to be their true self. We strive to make the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier, and a little bit safer each and every day."
2153,en,1,216,1,0.988812,positive,,positive,0.988812,One factor that makes good companies great is possessing a value system which allows them to solve problems over and over again; we embraced this way of thinking and welcome the challenges put forth by our customers.
2154,en,1,51,1,0.983452,positive,,positive,0.988731,Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
2155,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Mike Dastoor
2156,en,1,853,1,0.908784,positive,,positive,0.919259,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark just detailed, our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broad-based end-market strength and associated leverage, and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. We saw broad-based revenue strength across the business, most notably in mobility, cloud, healthcare, connected devices, automotive and semi-cap. Given the additional revenue, I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of 4.2%. And finally, our net interest expense came in better than expected during the quarter, due in large part to better working capital management coupled with the proactive steps we've taken over the past year to optimize our capital structure."
2157,en,1,681,1,0.556304,positive,,positive,0.697241,"Putting it all together on the next slide, net revenue for the second quarter was $6.8 billion, $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $700 million or 11%. GAAP operating income was $236 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99. Core operating income during the quarter was $285 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q2 was $33 million and core tax rate came in at approximately 23%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 154% improvement over the prior year quarter."
2158,en,1,680,1,0.783515,positive,,positive,0.767209,"Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis. The strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based as several of the end-markets we serve are becoming increasingly critical such as connected devices, healthcare, automotive and mobility. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.1%, 210 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.2 billion, also reflecting strong broad-based demand. Core margins for the segment were 3.1%, 80 basis points over the prior year."
2159,en,1,848,1,0.860995,positive,,positive,0.908693,"Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $20 million in Q2 and capital expenditures, net of customer co-investments, totaled $152 million. We exited the quarter with cash balance of $838 million. We ended Q2 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q2 with access to more than $4.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $82 million. At the end of the quarter $254 million remained outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization, and we intend to complete this authorization during the second half of FY '21 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders."
2160,en,1,909,1,0.66757,positive,1,positive,0.580495,"Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 19% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion; this is mainly due to strong end-market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.4 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion or an increase of 9% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $220 million to $270 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.89."
2161,en,1,1006,1,0.814681,positive,,positive,0.882633,"Next, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. In healthcare today, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We're in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare."
2162,en,1,586,1,0.840198,positive,,positive,0.793184,"Another end-market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today, electric vehicles account for less than 2% of total vehicles in the market. Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend."
2163,en,1,1047,1,0.943436,positive,,positive,0.94191,"Turning now to 5G; 5G will transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering, manufacturing and eco-friendly decommissioning observers [ph], all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times, security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers."
2164,en,1,700,1,0.792102,positive,,positive,0.769425,"Shifting now to packaging; we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally, within semi-cap, the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions, spanning the front-end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back-end with validation and test solutions."
2165,en,1,1101,1,0.919992,positive,,positive,0.934188,"In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results in the first half of FY '21. As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY '21 estimates for revenue, core operating income, core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $28.5 billion [ph]. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5. And importantly, despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts."

Maybe Mark, first question on the EMS side. You're guiding now to $13.4 billion that's almost a billion dollars higher than the previous guidance. But the operating margin is still guided at 3.6%. So just curious, I mean, why isn't the operating margin target for that for this year for EMS moving up a little bit more? Just if you can just talk about the puts and takes on that. Thanks."

2175,en,1,897,1,0.767872,positive,1,positive,0.754164,"Thanks, Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think you're right, we look at the overall corporate margin for the year, we think we'll be around 4.2%. And EMS will be in the range of I would guess 3.6%, 3.7%. I look at that relative to fiscal '19. If I go back that far, and I think EMS in '19, was around 3% all in. Last year, we're below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think we're doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business, some businesses that we've gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID. But most importantly, Ruplu, I think about things that Mike was talking about in his prepared remarks in terms of trends that we think are going to be around for a while. Things like 5G, electric vehicles, cloud computing, clean energy."
2176,en,1,257,1,0.608355,positive,1,positive,0.526209,"So I feel good about the year. We continue to make OpEx investments as well in the EMS segment, but I think we're on a good trajectory. The things I obsess about or worry about. The condition of the EMS business, the next two, three years isn't one of them."

I mean, are you concerned or how concerned are you about any configuration changes that might come up in the rest of the year? Can you may be at a high level, just talk about how prepared Jabil is this year versus in prior years about handling mobility related, you know, volatility that can come up in the rest of the year?"

Our relationship in that space with our main customer there is super solid. And when I just think back about the last two, three years of execution, I've got again, very little doubt in our ability to execute on the mobility side, configuration changes or not. So again, not an area that then I'm losing a lot of sleep over."

2186,en,1,810,1,0.68897,positive,1,positive,0.657083,"Okay, thanks. Good morning. Mark. I wanted to start with a question on operating margin and acknowledge it's been very strong so far. A two parter [ph] just on near term and long term moving forward. So first on near term, your Q3 guidance implies that total company operating margin is going to be down, maybe somewhere around mid-3% range or so and then back up to around 4% or so in Q4, based on the EPS guide if I got that correct, doesn't look like that's volume related because revenue is going to be flattish during this time. So, maybe just more color on drivers of the Q3 dip and rebound in Q4. And secondly, you mentioned longer term as you exit this year with a four handle. The trajectory that that puts you on as you think about fiscal '22 and beyond, because you said you wanted to build on that?"
2187,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Mark Mondello
2188,en,1,960,1,0.629186,positive,1,positive,0.646602,"Yes, thanks Adam. Q3 is always a little bit of a debit for us. And, as much as we take a lot of I don't know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What we've done in the last two, three years. But again, we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level, in terms of up margin. I think you're right, enterprise margins for Q3 will be around the 3.5% range. And, again, I compare that to last year, which maybe it's nonsense, because of COVID it's up substantially year-on-year. I'm going off a memory, but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal '19, we'd be up year-on-year in terms of Q3 to Q3 as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know, Q3 tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that I'm focused on more than anything is beginning of the year."
2189,en,1,868,1,0.590001,positive,1,positive,0.545706,"So we've had, we've strung together, I don't know, adding four, five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around 3.5%. That says we've really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September, we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin. 90 days ago in December, we took that up to four one now we're taking that up to four two. So I feel, I'm more focused on that trajectory than the quarter-on-quarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond '21, we'll give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September, I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that we're very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal '22. And that would be relative to the four two, that we hope to post this year."

2191,en,1,464,1,0.76304,positive,,positive,0.738276,"Got it. And maybe just as a follow up for Mike, you talked about being able to plan to generate over $600 million of free cash flow this year, wondering if that's also something that you can build on like Mark's comments on operating margin as we think about a go forward basis, or are there are CapEx investments to achieve that operating margin improvement? And maybe you can just tie in your capital allocation priorities as you answer that question? Thank you."
2192,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Mike Dastoor
2193,en,1,1266,1,0.594383,positive,1,positive,0.585573,"Thanks, Adam. Yes, definitely free cash flow will, I think we've said more than $600 million for this year, as we continue into FY '22. I expect that to continue to grow. Again, we've said this before CapEx is something where we've been extremely disciplined in that 2.9%, 3% range. So free cash flows next year again, we'll get guidance in September, but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid [ph] as it's done in FY '21. As relates to capital allocation Adam, we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks, we have to earn $34 million left of our authorization, we intend to complete their authorization in Q3 and Q4 or in the second half of the year. So that shows that we're extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into '22, '23. I don't want to preempt anything now. But I'm sure we'll be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the, I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages, roughly half buys into buybacks, dividends, some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic, sort of M&A as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward."

If I look at your updated guidance on the buy segments, am I correct that the 5G wireless and cloud is the one that kind of is giving you the most surprise there? And if so, are any of your segments or all of them or any of them experiencing semiconductor shortages? Are you able to procure all the components and items needed? Thank you."

2201,en,1,1308,1,0.763981,positive,,positive,0.777284,"Thanks, Jim. I assume you're talking about our eight sectors [ph]. Yes, so, I'm not quite sure we mean, in terms of surprise, in terms of the uplift, for sure. So I don't know that it's a surprise to us that we're seeing strength in 5G and cloud. Back in December, we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But we've been very bullish on the 5G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not, it's certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think that's largely both on the 5G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints, I would say that we talked about this a bit in December, let's say, nine months ago, or so. You know, there was demand drops everywhere, based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals, cut them abruptly. And then, at least our conversations with our customers, very few people anticipated the rebound that we've seen, which largely started August, September timeframe, and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of 2021. And on the supply side, again, all of that drove constraints."
2202,en,1,1105,1,0.628978,positive,1,positive,0.656271,"One good piece of information, I think to share is any type of supply constraints, whether it be around resin, whether it be around silicon, whether it be around passives, whether it be around mechanicals all that's handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q3 and Q4. So I feel if anything, maybe there's some slight upsides to what we've put out today, assuming that the supply constraints don't work and worse. And the other thing I would say is, I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale, if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning, whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive, our team's knowledge of the marketplace, the knowledge of the commodities, knowledge of technologies, and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel we're getting along and getting by quite well, all things considered on a relative basis."

First Mark, could you just give a little more color on where the healthcare solutions businesses on its margin journey and how it did in the quarter? You know, maybe referencing back to when you first did the J&J [ph] deal, and what you were thinking for next year? And then secondly, I just don't clear based on what you just said about constraints and potential inventory builds, Mike, you're talking about still doing $600 million in cash flow, free cash flow is the difference between prior thinking just basically higher EBIT, offset by more inventory investments or there other puts and takes.

And then secondly, I'm just trying to understand make sure I understand the that the cash flow target staying at $600 million plus, you have higher EBIT, but it sounds like higher inventory investments.

Steve Borges [ph] and his team who run that business, we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I don't even know how long ago now to 2.5 years ago, we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care, like personalized health, like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter, another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology, the investments that our healthcare teams are making, and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business, speed, last year, I think was in the neighborhood of $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion. And I would guess, as we exit this year, health care and packaging, we'll be bumping up against $5 billion. And I think we'll continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years."
2221,en,1,1119,1,0.443885,positive,1,positive,0.439389,"In terms of the $600 million of cash flow it's another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe it's a little bit confusing, because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldn't cash flow go up? We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two, three, four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team, we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as we're adding good quality business, again, attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins, as we look at '22 and '23. So if I take you back to the beginning of the year, we said we do $26.5 billion, $27 billion in revenue. Now we're bumping up against $28 billion, $28.5 billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital, the way the team's managing CapEx, and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August 31 of the year."

And I'm just wondering, Mark, if you can talk about how much of this is structural in the industry itself? And how much of it is under your control? What is that you are doing today that makes you feel sure that you're locking in higher margins in sort of medium term?"

2230,en,1,1061,1,0.703077,positive,,positive,0.652249,"I don't know that it's structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins that's always good but we're pretty inwardly focused, Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think, if we don't get that out of order, Paul, and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues; the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year, I was noticing something over the weekend, this will be along with the margin trajectory, I think this would be the first year we've ever had in the history of the company, if we execute, and that's a big capital, if but if we execute, we're going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds $1 per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion, you asked about is it structural? I think so. That's our plan and that's what will allow us to take margins up from the 4.2%, as we get into next year."
2231,en,1,1075,1,0.367964,positive,1,positive,0.357455,"And I think about everything from our balance sheet, if you take a look at, and again, now I'm coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve, net debts going down, interest expense is going down. Overall, liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very, very good overhead and overhead costs, I think about overall demand, I think about the secular trends that we've talked about, sometimes that's a really, really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets, which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then, the whole COVID thing, it's not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here, we hope to have 70%, 80% of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. It's just and then I think lastly, and we've been talking about this for 10 to 12 quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as it's ever been."
2232,en,1,286,1,0.746777,positive,,positive,0.773041,"So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again, I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around 3.5%. I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to, on a structural basis, increase margins by 100 basis points as we look forward after that 3.5% base."

Are you able to, it sounds like you had the choice of not doing some business, because you could be satisfying your customers delighting them even but it could be bad business that you're doing ultimately, from a margin perspective. So can you talk to us a little bit about how you shaped the portfolio and what you do at the front end to prevent low margin business coming in and hurting the overall business model?"

You know, I can tell you this, I've been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we don't communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where we're going and why we're going there and what our purpose is there's no better team, there just isn't. And so people understand that there's two things that we're focused on for the next two, three, four years, and that's continued expansion of cash flows, and continued expansion and margins. And by the way, our portfolio, we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side, but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin, but maybe the working capital is a little richer, we have some of that in our healthcare, space and other areas. But when you blend all that together, I think there's just a picture here, that we're just starting to paint. And, again, we feel pretty good for the next two to three years."

For sure, we're seeing stretch secular trends and trends that are very positive in terms of cloud and finally, what looks to be reasonable plans in terms of the 5G Wireless rollout. So that's going to be helpful. And we think that's here to stay for, not a number of months, but a number of years. And by the way, we think that's going to have all kinds of tangents tied to it as well, once the 5G rollout gets underway in terms of derivatives to other parts of our business. And then I think I complement that with saying, there's just been good acceptance of our solutions and our services in the space, both on the design side, I think Mike alluded to, he was using some fancy terms around, what we call a kind of designed to dust and repurposing older servers. And he did a nice job explaining it, but it sounds a little, I don't know, overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side, all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware, kind of front to back, I think, Shannon, the solutions we have in that space. Again, it's still what I would call early days, but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well."

I can't make sense of the US equity markets anymore, because I don't know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put $4 trillion of stimulus into the system, and there's dollars everywhere, they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters, maybe into 1Q of '22. But the nice thing is, so as we navigate '21, I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors, some of those will dissipate, some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulus-related. In certain parts of the United States right now, you go and you try to buy a truck or car, an appliance, whatever it may be; there is backlogs everywhere, and I think that's stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus, and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it, I think what's right behind that is kind of -- no kidding, no nonsense secular trends. And again, Mike talked about it, I talked about it in our prepared remarks; and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two, three, four years, so it's not like I'm sitting here going, geez, when stimulus abates [ph], when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce -- that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So, I don't know if that helps or gets at your question, but that's how I see it."

Mark, your commentary across end-markets extremely positive; one area that you're still guiding down year-over-year as networking and storage. Looks like you took that up a little bit from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion but still down. Could you tell us what you're seeing in that market? Is there still weakness in on-prim spend and expectations of that improving as the recovery continues post-COVID?"

2259,en,1,1383,1,0.632237,positive,1,positive,0.685948,"Yes, sure. So the network storage business was around $2.8 billion in fiscal '20. September, we took that all the way down to $2.2 billion, and again, that's a reflection of a couple of things; it's a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing, and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is; again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal '22 and '23, there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital, might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is, from the September timeframe to December timeframe, to today, we've actually been on a trajectory back up. So that's nothing more than, A) we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space; and we'll continue to serve those customers, serve them well; and as long as they'll have us, and appreciate the value we provide, we're all in. And -- so I -- again, I think about $2.8 billion in '20 to down $2.2 billion in the last -- I think December, and today we've taken it back up by $200 million roughly. And I would just look at -- I'd look at network and storage as a -- a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses, margins might be tight, cash flows are quite good, so it's a very good complement to the other seven sectors."

And as part of that the good news is, almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes, but we will continue to complement that with select M&A activity, and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition you're talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership, a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that they've developed, and we always ask ourselves the question; when we're looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment, we start with capability and competency, and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging, and this is kind of a second or third step for us, we believe that we'll be able to take that technology, and as we look towards fiscal '22, fiscal '23, give that technology -- it's due in terms of further R&D, and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet, our scale and our relationships."

The company's doing very well on margins and guiding to 4.2% for this year, despite what I would think are some temporary cost headwinds related to the supply chain environment, including the shipping cost as the most important component shortages that the whole industry is having to deal with. Can you talk about how much of a headwind the company may be seeing from some of those supply chain types of costs this year? And if we were to add that back, do you think that's more representative of the underlying margin levels that the company can hopefully build off of going forward?

You know, I -- geez [ph], I said earlier, we've -- we've certainly handicapped the business for Q3 and Q4, and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that -- you know, if we didn't handicap the business, maybe margins would be 4.3% for the year, I wouldn't get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier, Mark, the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management, it's wonderful. And just listening to others, either a few customers, suppliers or folks in our industry, we're navigating this thing beautifully, and it's a tough deal but the impact to us, I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again, as we sit here today, we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week, and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief, as we get into 1Q of 2022 and for sure, as we get into calendar 2022.

My follow-up question was on the EV opportunity, and automotive has been a growing business for Jabil, and an area I realized that Jabil has a lot of capabilities already; Foxconn is moving to divert or brought it out it's business in doing full electric vehicle architectures, and even final car assembly. I'm interested if that's the type of business that Jabil would also consider expanding into within the automotive and EV space? Thanks."

2278,en,1,1392,1,0.80564,positive,1,positive,0.770945,"I think it's a part right [ph] to think that we'll set up automotive factories. The capital intensity, that is enormous, and I don't want our people focused away from what we do really, really well which is sensors, components, sub-assemblies for the entire automotive space; and thank you for the compliment on that, we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half, three years ago was -- is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV, not just with automobiles but all the transportation; and I think that -- I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification, that would suggest right in our core and the R&D dollars and the investments we've made in that area have been substantial; so I feel pretty good about how we're positioned there, and we'll see how that plays out for '22 and '23. If I had to speculate, make a little bit of a guess today; I think today we look at that the -- the H-sector [ph] chart and -- in FY '20 automotive transport was about $1.7 billion, in September we took that up to $1.9 billion. We're sitting here today saying it will be a bit over $2.2 billion. And I would -- if I had to venture a guess today, I would say the trajectory of that sector as we move through '22 is going to continue to be up and to the right. Thank you."

First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we’re pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we’re prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term, and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It’s why I wouldn’t trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic, we have stayed focused on our unique advantages, and we’ve been resolute in fueling innovation, and our brand is as strong as ever."
2311,en,1,659,1,0.853623,positive,,positive,0.831517,"I am proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products, new campaigns, the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still, we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week, we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5-year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025, outlining clear goals, action plans and accountability. And for the first time, that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals."
2312,en,1,1033,1,0.860994,positive,,positive,0.88921,"Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities, from sustainability to representation, to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately, this isn’t just the right thing to do, it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value, raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense, accelerating our long-term strategy. And as I said, this continues to be a dynamic external environment, but I am proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens, COVID spikes, forced enclosed – store closures, port congestion on the West Coast and more, this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win."
2313,en,1,531,1,0.744991,positive,1,positive,0.713775,"Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers’ number one favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both men’s and women’s businesses. We’re also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China, where our strong portfolio of brands, including Jordan and Converse, is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world, the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us, driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy."
2314,en,1,916,1,0.823068,positive,,positive,0.832374,"First, NIKE’s connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon, having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbappé became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals, leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball, with Lebron’s team taking on KD’s, Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today, with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 women’s teams and 15 of the top 16 men’s teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world."
2315,en,1,572,1,0.803255,positive,,positive,0.826974,"Second, our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We’ve had tremendous success in digital, quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries, NIKE’s digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever, the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful."
2316,en,1,771,1,0.837723,positive,,positive,0.779796,"Third, we stay at the front of the pack, thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter, we announced the launch of SNKRS Live, our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3, we doubled the number of countries with live streaming, adding Japan, Germany and Italy. We’re seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 minutes I wish it were 15 years, well above the industry norms. We’re also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community, content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether it’s through the SNKRS App, our Activity apps, platforms like TikTok and more, we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital."
2317,en,1,606,1,0.919645,positive,,positive,0.901376,"And fourth, the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter, growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broad-based, led by our biggest growth opportunities: digital, international, apparel and women’s. In fact, Jordan’s women’s business was up nearly triple digits, a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee, one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever, with more than $175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward."
2318,en,1,637,1,0.881685,positive,,positive,0.923263,"As always, our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovation’s at our core, reflecting not just our foundational values, but the values we share with consumers. We don’t just innovate for the elite athlete we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners."
2319,en,1,639,1,0.830422,positive,,positive,0.894597,"This quarter, we focused on a key problem for runners, with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running, with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape, a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape’s silhouette, materials and design details are all aimed at new runners, and it’s seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport."
2320,en,1,1305,1,0.821057,positive,,positive,0.813757,"We are also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We’ve set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we’ll continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month, we launched Cosmic Unity, our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative, which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon, embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity, which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA’s best, including Anthony Davis, is NIKE’s first performance shoe made out of at least 25% recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. We are also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on, easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star, the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone, from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We’re initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights."
2321,en,1,651,1,0.865074,positive,,positive,0.88578,"This quarter, we acquired Datalogue, a data integration platform that will help us process, analyze and act on the data we enjoy, thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data, turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment, we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights, along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning, creates a capacity that no other brand has."
2322,en,1,551,1,0.921212,positive,,positive,0.93377,"Let’s quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games, we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace, including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation, as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations."
2323,en,1,573,1,0.834344,positive,,positive,0.801297,"The last thing I’d like to discuss is digital. We’re taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent, seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners, we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving, with growth of 54% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America, which had its first-ever quarter with $1 billion in digital revenue."
2324,en,1,1200,1,0.860842,positive,,positive,0.839298,"As you know, we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered, being 50% of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date, increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKE’s ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever, with an over 60% increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter, led by our SNKRS App, where we’re seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We’re seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80% versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores, member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases, enabled by robust store training programs, member-specific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active, high-value members across all of our channels."
2325,en,1,262,1,0.716693,positive,,positive,0.715985,"In the end, NIKE is staying on offense and we are focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook, led by digital, and everything we’ve seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long-term and we are not slowing down."

2328,en,1,874,1,0.587572,positive,1,positive,0.52917,"Thank you, John and hello to everyone on the call. As we have entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges, our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future, the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. For example, in Q3, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand."
2329,en,1,990,1,0.679366,positive,1,positive,0.682941,"In North America specifically, inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks, impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA, additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and/or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we’re focused on what we can control: optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility, accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team’s unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn’t have said it any better, we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future."
2330,en,1,485,1,0.873957,positive,,positive,0.870133,"Now as I reflect on the third quarter, I want to highlight two important points. First, NIKE’s brand momentum is as strong as ever, and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full-price sales with lower markdown activity, and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season."
2331,en,1,1241,1,0.819746,positive,,positive,0.767927,"At our core, NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies, growing revenue 42% on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year, with digital demand doubling versus fiscal ‘19. NIKE Digital grew 54%, led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90% versus the prior year. Women’s drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter, including nearly 90% growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace, we are increasing NIKE’s market share across our key markets. And last, the Jordan Brand grew 15%, delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business, and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling, to our deep consumer connections, our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms, NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality, sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio."
2332,en,1,707,1,0.892685,positive,,positive,0.872109,"Second, this quarter demonstrated how a more direct, digitally enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70% year-to-date, and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds 35% of our total business. This quarter, we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal ‘22 and beyond, we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel, with digital mix increasing towards our 50% vision."
2333,en,1,996,1,0.876531,positive,,positive,0.86396,"NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live, Rise and Unite will create distinctive, authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale, while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly, they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter, where member checkout rates reached 90%, paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal ‘22."
2334,en,1,615,1,0.911945,positive,,positive,0.918214,"As I’ve said before, this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter, NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points, being fueled by a higher mix of digital, which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead."
2335,en,1,648,1,0.695787,positive,,positive,0.710216,"During Q3 in North America, we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product, marketing and service recommendations, ultimately increasing member buying frequency, basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct, member-centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most."
2336,en,1,735,1,0.0,neutral,,negative,-0.59071,"Now let’s turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 3% in Q3, declining 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 16%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year, resulting from higher full price product margins, due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds."
2337,en,1,773,1,-0.316548,negative,1,positive,0.327369,"SG&A declined 7% in the quarter, as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions, along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% compared to 3.9% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up 70% versus the prior year. As a reminder, prior year EPS included a $0.25 non-cash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America."
2338,en,1,836,1,-0.416077,negative,1,negative,-0.554253,"With that, let’s turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However, starting in late December, container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply, delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct, however, grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50% and we have seen this momentum continue into March."
2339,en,1,799,1,0.568912,positive,,positive,0.68519,"This quarter, we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand, inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Inventory in North America grew 31% versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20%. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year, we expect continued full price momentum, despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics."

Across most countries in Western Europe, government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures, with approximately 45% of our NIKE-owned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April, we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal ‘22."

But in markets where our stores have reopened, we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum, with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth year-over-year, complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE-owned and partner stores mostly closed, we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business, which grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, led by the NIKE App, which grew triple digits in the quarter, and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March."

NIKE Direct grew 52% versus the prior year, with more than 40% growth in digital and nearly 60% growth in NIKE-owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal, including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores, widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier, Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense, we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment, including the Dunk Low and the women’s Dunk Disrupt, which both instantly sold out. Our women’s business grew more than 60% versus the prior year and our 2 new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital, we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms, including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year, we doubled our number of high-value members.

NIKE Digital grew nearly 70% on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days.

We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the continued shifts we’ve seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA.

As a growth company, our offense is working. NIKE’s brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating, the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply, more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners.

Are you going to move it to more the apps or the online, the SNKRS App or Nike.com app? Just could you give us a little more color around the plans to move that inventory in the fourth quarter?

2359,en,1,1327,1,0.754881,positive,,positive,0.731412,"Sure. Well, as I mentioned, we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We’ve now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year, but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. I mentioned, Bob, in my prepared remarks that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And we’re seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail, which is our strategic partners, than we’re seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today, it’s down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct, and we continue to – we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations."

2377,en,1,907,1,0.745187,positive,,positive,0.742804,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions and Matt, I wanted to ask you, I think you just said that you raised the revenue growth rate for the year. Obviously, that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG&A for the year at up low singles, and now you’re saying up slightly, while you’re raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there, too. So I’m trying to put the – just at a high level, the picture together. It seems like there is either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer term, or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG&A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line?"

2379,en,1,1175,1,0.692745,positive,1,positive,0.646804,"Sure. Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren’t going to be linear as compared to where we’ve been in prior quarters, nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels, I need to start with the core principle, which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us, we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. Now in the middle of COVID, we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly – and from a disciplined perspective, managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy, like our tech – end-to-end tech transformation, digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so we’ve continued to do that while we’ve been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we’re in."
2380,en,1,1457,1,0.456312,positive,1,positive,0.407231,"As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic, we don’t intend to just add it back in, okay? Every dollar we’re putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so we’re taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point, historically, prior to COVID, we were at about 33% of revenue in terms of our SG&A levels, and we’ve been able to manage through the last – the first three quarters of this year, closer to 29%. And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period, the reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that, demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID, we were at something like 9% or 10% of revenue, and it fell to about 7% in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don’t think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half, our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won’t get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time, but we believe that that’s the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery."
2381,en,1,850,1,0.603,positive,,positive,0.747429,"So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring, we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. We’re going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Women’s, we’re going to continue to be investing internationally, as I mentioned, against – we’re going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term, Michael, that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time."

It sounds like there is a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America, a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model, and you’ve made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the – I’m curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business, but you still do have strategic partners through – with stores through the U.S. In the past, we’ve seen you segment by House of Hoops, Track Club, the big installations at Dick’s Sporting Goods, those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when, if you’re going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business?"

2385,en,1,1838,1,0.846821,positive,,positive,0.801175,"Well, Michael, we start with the consumer, we start in every case with the consumer, and the consumer is really clear that they want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And they want a seamless, premium digital and physical experience. In fact, in many cases, they don’t see a difference between digital and physical, whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store, whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence, both ours and our partners. And the way we’ll go forward is we are driving, starting with our own digital and our own stores, the seamless premium experience that’s centered on the member, where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are, whether they are in our stores or our partner stores. And so we’ll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience, a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And so as we segment, it’s – we’re leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again, I think you’ll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of – a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience."

I’m on my, I guess, 14 month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands and frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior – to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising – these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it’s quite powerful. And we’re probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example I’ll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they are getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not – they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers, brand-wise, but also that when we talk about the consistent premium, seamless experience, online to offline, that deliver consumers, we’re furthest along. We’re furthest along in China, and I give that team huge credit, and we’re rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions."

And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter, and it continues to have significant impact, not only on localizing product but also – localizing product, but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. And then Erinn, maybe one other indication vis-à-vis China being ahead of other places, as the world has opened up, sport is returning. And so just the energy that we’re seeing with sport returning, we’re seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market, and it gives us a lot of optimism as we’re looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America, Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America, what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans, and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we’ve been seeing year-to-date as we are shifting, creating the marketplace shifts and continuing to lead with NIKE Direct and our strategic partners."

On – Omar, on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what’s possible, we’re just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really – has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that’s all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you’re the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our – who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that’s even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants."
2402,en,1,1375,1,0.837361,positive,,positive,0.815678,"And so I’d say we’re into our data journey, but there is so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it. With respect to women’s, the women’s business is having a great momentum. It was the – I think eighth straight quarter where women’s growth out indexed overall growth. And that’s across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, marketplace retail, grew to high double digits, and we’re gaining share in women’s, both on footwear and apparel. And while we’re seeing success in women’s to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we’ve described with a real dedicated and focused women’s team, means that we can increase our investment. So we’ve doubled our investment in women’s innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier, this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it’s just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women’s business."

And we just – it would be hard, Omar, to size the opportunity because the women’s market is so large. And we see the opportunity relative to where our business is penetrated today. And so while we continue to take share, those definitions are within the refinement of the way people define the market from an athletic footwear and athletic apparel in this. But what we’re also seeing is athletic taking share of the broader women’s marketplace. And so those are going to be fuel for growth for us as we continue to invest behind this exciting opportunity."

2410,en,1,475,1,0.835025,positive,,positive,0.832921,"Thanks so much. John, I think we’ve talked on several calls about the investment in data and even on this one. And so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Datalogue acquisition? And then I think, Matt, on prior calls has talked about the margin advantage of digital. But it seems to me that there is some real P&L benefits from the scaling of data. So if you kind of had to dream the dream, what do you think the opportunity is there? Thank you."

2412,en,1,2006,1,0.73707,positive,1,positive,0.721432,"Well, Matt, maybe I’ll dream the dream around the consumer, and you can dream the dream around our income statement. I think they are very linked. Jamie, it’s – I had to say we’re just scratching the surface. I mean, so yes, Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate, translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you’re beginning to see whether it’s improved and personalized search results, whether you’re seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it’s anticipating timing of when you’re due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it’s what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don’t want people, they don’t want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, and two, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that’s one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we’re going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said, scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is – it’s true in the technology industry. It’s also true, I think, in our industry, and so we’ll have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt, do you want to comment, add to that?"

2414,en,1,1248,1,0.845554,positive,,positive,0.835198,"Yes. So I’ll dream the dream on the financial side of it. We think that, as I’ve said for several quarters in a row, and Andy said before me, that the financial value of data and technology are significant for us. And we’re already starting to see some of it, Jamie, in our current performance, but the opportunity in front of us is significant. It’s being right more of the time. And where you’ll see it drive financial value through our P&L is making better pricing and merchandising decisions, where we place our inventory, how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in, and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking – is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise, as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end, there is going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think you’ll also see productivity in SG&A over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion. And so we’re investing heavily towards all of those opportunities."

The science, the science of what we are doing, it’s been done, it’s doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. It’s the creativity of our apparel designers, of our footwear designers. It’s the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesn’t displace art. It’s both. It’s data and technology help enhance it and supplement it. But this – the core of this, the heart and soul of this company is an amazing wellspring of creativity and innovation and the mindset in everything we do. And so I just – this is going to make it a little bit more direct-to-consumer and make it a little bit more efficient. But we will never lose sight of the art of what NIKE, Jordan and Converse do. So, with that, Andy time to wrap up."

However, as I reflect on the last 12 months, I am pleased to say that despite these challenges our team exhibited impressive resilience, which allowed us to advance our strategy and establish a foundation for Pure-Vu in the market. It's important to remind everyone that we are in the early stages of tapping into the opportunity before us."
2449,en,1,264,1,0.402598,positive,1,positive,0.392063,"In terms of market size, with more than 50 million procedures per year, colonoscopy is one of the single largest procedures in all of Med Tech. The unmet need associated with poor bowel prep is universally recognized, both from a clinical and economic perspective."
2450,en,1,304,1,0.599754,positive,1,positive,0.600019,"The thesis which motivated me to join Motus as its CEO two and a half years ago has not changed. Our Pure-Vu system has clear first mover advantage, meaning we believe we currently have no direct competition and we continue to protect our core technologies through a growing portfolio of granted patents."
2451,en,1,392,1,-0.626989,negative,1,negative,-0.570973,"The task at hand is now focused on establishing our entry position in this market and changing longstanding behaviors, both of which are challenging tasks that require focus, patience and deliberate execution. We're asking physicians and their staff to think differently about patient flow, with the goal of eliminating archaic and unnecessary delayed hospitalizations due to poor bowel prep."
2452,en,1,408,1,0.91509,positive,,positive,0.919324,"This shift in mindset requires an enhanced commitment to improving patient care and a focus towards fixing the unprofitable economics for the hospital under the current standard of care. Moreover addressing unmet needs and solving these clinical challenges requires physicians, nurses and support staff to adopt a new technology and learn to utilize it effectively in cases they encounter on a regular basis."
2453,en,1,542,1,0.776584,positive,1,positive,0.806585,"My experience tells me that changing behaviors doesn't happen overnight, it requires tenacity, telling the story each and every day and being highly targeted in our approach to influencing one physician at a time. While this process may take longer than we'd like, it doesn't change what we're playing for here, establishing Pure-Vu as a new standard of care in the large global colonoscopy market. I am confident that our shareholders, our customers and their patients will greatly benefit as we execute toward our goal of long term success."
2454,en,1,239,1,0.802529,positive,,positive,0.797589,I'd like to highlight the decisive and disciplined approach we have taken in our business since COVID-19 began one year ago. We acted with urgency in March and April 2020 cutting our quarterly cash burn by about 50% as the year progressed.
2455,en,1,485,1,0.900999,positive,,positive,0.897932,"We streamlined our areas of focus and our internal projects, continuing only those projects that we believe would enhance our business and help build medium and long term shareholder value. We strengthened our base of shareholders and our balance sheet in 2020 and early 2021, bringing in more than $20 million of additional equity capital. And finally, we continue to build strong customer relationships and gained evaluations at more than two dozen targeted hospitals across the U.S."
2456,en,1,451,1,0.688201,positive,,positive,0.81615,"Despite current market related headwinds, which are mainly attributed to COVID-19, we are in the strongest financial position since Motus GI was established and are well situated to come out of the other side of this pandemic. We believe our sales and marketing teams’ nimble approach to remain engaged with keys positions has been very effective, particularly when considering the unique environment with lockdowns and social distancing requirements."
2457,en,1,350,1,0.934717,positive,,positive,0.955483,"In the third quarter we saw a nice rebound in our business, primarily driven by an uptick in procedure volume and having on-site access to most of our hospitals. While that trend continued into early Q4, the resurgence of COVID-19 in specific geographies, particularly California and Texas created a slowdown in our momentum in November and December."
2458,en,1,206,1,-0.328084,negative,,negative,-0.328084,"With that said, I'm pleased that from a revenue perspective, despite the uptick in COVID-19 related issues in Q4, we sold more disposable sleeves than in Q3 and conducted roughly as many Pure-Vu procedures."
2459,en,1,705,1,0.598294,positive,1,positive,0.504533,"In Q4 we also successfully negotiated two new 12 month committed contracts at prominent medical centers, the University of Texas and NYU, which are both in effect for 2021. In both instances the customer made a commitment to minimum quarterly purchases for our Pure-Vu sleeves and for doing so, we are allowing the early adopters what we are calling centers of excellence to utilize our capital equipment at no additional cost, while these minimums are met or exceeded. We believe deploying this razor blade model works well in instances where capital funding is currently unavailable, as it permit the customer to expand use of the Pure-Vu system, while providing us with more predictable sleeve volumes."
2460,en,1,527,1,-0.326527,negative,,negative,-0.370915,"Given the current capital environment, we expect to complete additional agreements like these with early adopter hospitals in the first half of the year. You may also recall that University of Texas and NYU are two locations that have implemented a protocol that identifies clear clinical circumstances where the Pure-Vu system should be utilized, which is also resulting in more consistent usage patterns. Replicating similar patient identification protocols in additional Pure-Vu site, is a key focus for our commercial team."
2461,en,1,407,1,-0.345057,negative,,negative,-0.4719,"In the fourth quarter we also expanded our business by initiating product evaluations at new accounts, most notably the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and Mass General Hospital in Boston. While we may not see the current environment begin to normalize immediately, we believe as hospital access returns and GI procedures rebound to pre-pandemic levels, we are poised to drive an acceleration of Pure-Vu utilization."
2462,en,1,482,1,0.554757,positive,1,positive,0.301895,"Due to the pandemic, we've yet to benefit from having all of our hospitals fully up and running at any one time over the past year. As part of our fiscal discipline, we are currently fielding a small customer facing team. This team is doing a great job driving the result that I summarized, and as we see a more favorable environment emerge, we will look to thoughtfully invest in expanding our commercial organization with the goal of driving faster utilization and revenue growth."
2463,en,1,302,1,0.823568,positive,,positive,0.815441,"I want to switch gears to upcoming catalysts for the business. We have identified four value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to meaningfully enhance and accelerate our business in 2021 and beyond. They are reimbursement, product innovation, clinical data and strategic partnerships."
2464,en,1,389,1,0.591642,positive,,positive,0.666762,"Let me start with reimbursement. In the back half of 2020, we began to develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at positioning Pure-Vu for reimbursement coverage in both the in-patient and the out-patient settings. While there are many pathways to achieve both public and private coverage, we are initially focused on CMS programs designed to provide payment for new and unique technologies."
2465,en,1,469,1,0.587932,positive,1,positive,0.634548,"In the fourth quarter we submitted an application to CMS for a new technology add-on payment, sometimes referred to NTAP. This program could provide reimbursement for Pure-Vu during in-patient colonoscopy. As part of this submission, we also applied for an ICD-10 code. As you may have seen in a recent press release, on March 9 we participated in CMS's Coordination Meeting where I am pleased to share that they recommended Pure-Vu to be considered for an ICD-10 code."
2466,en,1,270,1,-0.256263,negative,1,positive,0.382941,"CMS is now conducting an open comment period and then the final decision will be made through a subsequent clearing process. If a code is awarded and substantively NTAP coverage, we believe adoption and utilization of Pure-Vu in the in-patient market can be accelerated."
2467,en,1,295,1,0.470528,positive,,positive,0.470528,We also submitted an application for CMS's transitional pass-through payment. This program could provide reimbursement for traditional outpatient procedures. We believe high medical need patience that can't successfully complete their pre-procedural bowl prep would benefit greatly from Pure-Vu.
2468,en,1,311,1,0.883977,positive,,positive,0.861931,"Securing pass-through coverage for our system could be a significant catalyst for our business, as it would provide economic incentives for physicians to use Pure-Vu on the roughly 5 million high medical need procedures each year in the U.S. It would also mark our first entry into the large out-patient market."
2469,en,1,355,1,0.912725,positive,,positive,0.920611,"Next, I'd like to discuss new product innovation. I am pleased to report that our product development efforts to launch our first Pure-Vu system for use in Upper GI endoscopy is on track and we expect to submit a 510-K application to the FDA by early Q3. This would potentially position us with an approved and available product on the market by early Q4."
2470,en,1,537,1,0.459604,positive,,negative,-0.369874,"We view this as a significant opportunity and believe our technology can potentially address a serious unmet need in the market as it relates to visualization and the treatment of Upper GI bleeding, which has an estimated mortality rate of approximately 10%. There are roughly 400,000 Upper GI procedures in the U.S. annually and we continue to receive significant inbound interest from GI physicians who are eager for a solution that allows them to clear adherent blood and clots from their field of view during this critical procedure."
2471,en,1,589,1,0.76204,positive,,positive,0.772067,"Next, let's discuss clinical data generation. I'm excited to announce today that we recently began enrollment in a study with the Cleveland Clinic, which will evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of using the Pure-Vu system in patients with emergent lower GI bleeding that are treated in the ICU or the rapid inpatient endoscopy suite. This study is designed to enroll at least 20 patients to undergo minimal bowel prep in order to provide patients a much faster diagnosis as compared to the current period of 24 to 36 hours or more, typically required to complete a full bowl prep."
2472,en,1,280,1,-0.823891,negative,,negative,-0.90988,"The outcome we receive from this study could begin to challenge the current standard of care for emergent Lower GI bleed patients who are facing urgent need for diagnosis and treatment, but are currently delayed. We expect to have this study fully enrolled before the end of 2021."
2473,en,1,579,1,0.842738,positive,,positive,0.811276,"And lastly, I want to talk about strategic partnerships. As it relates to our strategic options, we've spent time evaluating a number of potential pathways during the back half of 2020 and into 2021. Our objectives in considering any potential partnership would be aimed at opportunities that could accelerate our commercial efforts and enhance our technology development. Any partnership would also need to unlock clear shareholder value. As we continue to grow awareness and uptake of the Pure-Vu system, we will consider which options best fit our criteria and are actionable."
2474,en,1,103,1,0.703914,positive,,positive,0.860878,I will now ask Andrew to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Andrew.

You know maybe you could share a little bit more detail on how those are structured. You know how many sleeves do you expect those two centers to order and – or I guess how many do they have to order to reach those requirement. And then, you know how should we be thinking about that from, maybe a revenue or quarterly cadence perspective."

So, first of all we're really excited to be able to ink these first initial committed agreements and as I mentioned, you know in my prepared remarks the capital environment very difficult, right, and at the end of the day our conviction is all around driving this procedure, getting physicians trained and getting them comfortable using the device and really improving patient care. So this is a way to get the product in, when they don't have the capital budget, but also gives us a commitment back pretty much more predictable volumes at least initially."
2498,en,1,503,1,0.624537,positive,,positive,0.624537,"While we're not going to give out specific, you know contractual details that we have with these customers, what I can tell you generally is we've talked before about you know first year utilization, we feel is typically going to be in the seven to ten procedures a month and these agreements are written to fully cover that and we expect them actually to grow much larger than that, because in most of these situations we have just a small number of the physicians who are actually doing the procedure."
2499,en,1,442,1,0.823257,positive,,positive,0.795438,"So hopefully that gives you a little bit of feel. You can kind of model that out, but that's the way they're structure today. And you know what we’d likely expect over time is that their capital budgets free up. I would think that most of these customers would end up then you know moving to either an outright purchase of the capital or you know lease agreement. But right now this is a great way to get them up and running with the product."

Can you just remind us of how you know some of those processes are structured; I guess especially during COVID here. I mean what’s the requirement from training, what's the requirement from you know as far as having a sales person on the ground or anything like that. And then you know how long does it typically take with some of those account. I mean obviously we’ve talked about NYU in the past, before you start seeing meaningful utilization of Pure-Vu."

So there is probably not a one size fits all answer in terms of the approach that each of these sites have asked us to kind of work within, as it relates to you know the impact of COVID on their staff and you know protocols and things like that. But typically, the structure that we believe optimizes our successes."
2504,en,1,380,1,0.646268,positive,,positive,0.646268,"You know if we can be there on-site and do initial training for the entire staff that will be associated with the product, as well as of course the physicians, you know and have kind of a kick off meeting if you will and then everyone's on the same page as it relates to what the technology does, what the benefit is. We make sure that we coordinate with the nursing floors right."
2505,en,1,297,1,0.350823,positive,,negative,-0.366169,"So if you got these patients that are up on the floor, waiting to have a colonoscopy done, they fully understand they are educated that now there's a solution down in GI that allowed them to do the procedure despite the patient being ready. So there is a lot of coordination that needs to be done."
2506,en,1,466,1,0.592042,positive,,positive,0.582545,"So in an ideal situation, we are there on-site, initially doing all of that organizational work if you will. And that has continued in several sites. As a matter of fact our evaluation in Boston that we just did here at the end of the year and into the first quarter, we were able to be on-site despite what was happening with COVID. Their protocols allowed for that, so we can follow that very approach and we had a rep and you know clinical training folks on site."
2507,en,1,585,1,0.631792,positive,1,positive,0.512459,"But in some of the other accountant and it's been a little bit of an elongated process throughout this year, we've not been able to be there. So we had to use remote tools and we talked about this before in the past, but we – you know we really digitized all of our materials, so now we're able to do things very effectively over the phone, via Zoom, you know there’s chapter narrated video that our staff has in front of them, so they can see exactly how the system set up and you know it's worked, it's worked out well. It just takes a little bit longer to try to manage it that way."
2508,en,1,374,1,0.510253,positive,1,positive,0.543179,"So the sales process, you know I would say has been taking probably upwards of you know six months plus given some of those hurdles, and in the back end the value analysis committees have been on and off meeting; it's been kind of stop and go. So I would say this is a very unusual last 12 months as it relates to the typical time that it would take to get these deals done."

So we will have the product on the market. Our initial plan is to do a very targeted – I would call it a kind of a soft launch as soon as we get it out there. We will have those accounts lined up, we’ll have the physicians lined up, and will get you know feedback from the market initially, and then we would move into you know a broader launch, but we're very excited about that."

You know Q3 was definitely a marked point where we saw a procedure volume come back to – you know I think in Q3 I talked about – you know call it 80% to 85% of pre-pandemic levels, kind of was the feel we had from speaking to our customers and you know that really for the most part continued into Q4 and you know I think that's what – you know if we look at Q1, it feels about the same.

It was very specific to geographies. You know California where we have several installations, Texas where we have several installations that were just getting hit hard, you know it impacted procedure volumes."
2557,en,1,354,1,0.836496,positive,,positive,0.982494,"I think Q1 is probably looking similar to what we saw in Q3 and Q4, but we are optimistic now as I think everyone is you know with the roll out and really an acceleration of the rollout of the vaccinations that you know we are expecting to see improvement in Q2 and you know in talking to physicians in our key hospitals, they've kind of echoed that, so."

What I mean by that is we can go in you know without a lot of trouble and be there and be in procedures, but the others have a lot of protocols in place that make it very, very difficult to be there and to get into different units and we still have certain types that we can't get in at all.

You know obviously we have another update today that they are now also you know signed to a committed volume agreement. The physicians that we work with there are terrific and have really embraced Pure-Vu, so I would say generally speaking it's going very well. And yes, it's going to take time to get to that full penetration point, but I think we're seeing – even if you look in this past quarter, we're seeing consistent reordering, we're seeing them gain a significant degree of independence."
2563,en,1,346,1,0.874101,positive,,positive,0.847748,"So what I mean by that is they are doing procedures when we're not there, which is the goal, right, and they're getting – you know that just shows the comfort level that they have, and you know we're talking to them about some other ways to collaborate over time here. So I think we'll see them as a very important customer for us moving forward."
2564,en,1,626,1,0.730718,positive,,positive,0.730718,"The other thing that’s unique if you will about NYU and I think we've talked about this a little bit is, the way they are structured from a physician's perspective is they have a director of in-patient services, GI Hospital if you will that is on site, on a consistent basis, right. So other facilities will have physicians that are on rotation and if it's a large GI group they might have you know physicians that you know are there doing in-patient rotation once a month or even a longer space between, whereas at NYU you have key physicians that are there each week and their full objective is to work on these in-patients."
2565,en,1,437,1,0.979411,positive,,positive,0.979411,"So obviously that's a captive audience for us and you know it’s a learning that we took over the course of last year, that as we expand our targets, focusing on some of these accounts that are structured that way, can really optimize success and really accelerated success, because you're talking about you know a lot fewer physicians that we need to get up and running, to try to get to you know that standard of care level if you will."

But you know I think you know given the size of the institution and the number of patients that we you know outlined here, it certainly has the potential to move relatively quickly. But at this point until we have better line of sight, which I think we will. By next quarter we’ll know how many we've done and what the pace looks like, we can provide a, probably a more specific targeted date, but for now we wanted to keep it general."

And then finally on the minimum sleeve purchase commitments, you know I know some of these are obviously larger institutions, more than one location. You know as you start out, you have kind of seven to 10 procedures a month, and that you are doing at maybe at the main location. What happens when they say this is great, let's expand these protocols system wide? We want more of these? How do you handle that? I mean is it kind of that seven to 10 procedures per hospital or you’d do it on a bigger basis, or how would you think about structuring that down the road should things go well?"

So they're not three years or something, because things will change and I think as the new technology in the market, you know as we're out there, you know as they said earlier, really our biggest objective right, and challenge is change in behavior, right. So we're asking physicians and staff to do something differently than they've done in the past, right, any type of new technology."

I saw in some of your commentary that you mentioned a portion was from new accounts and a portion was from existing accounts. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what this proportion look like, even just at a high level, does have to be specific, but perhaps a range?"

Yes, so we definitely don't want to you know start to break it out to that level of detail, but I would say that a large portion of the early revenues that we're seeing here are coming from existing repeat orders. So what that will look like is in any given quarter, the majority of the revenue is coming from repeat orders and then you're going to potentially get a couple initial orders to get going and I think that happened here in the last quarter. So we had an account that you know switched and got the approval right at the end of the quarter and placed their first paid purchase, but that's obviously a small majority of the revenue that we're seeing right now."

So just depending on when they make the commitment and place their first order, that amount could certainly change."

We have done, I would say a high level exploration and diligence into Europe and into Asia as it relates to the opportunity for Pure-Vu and we’ve had inbound request from several different entities, interested in either selling or you know having access to Pure-Vu in their market, so we're evaluating those."

2655,en,1,406,1,0.594363,positive,,positive,0.614161,"But I think generally what we're seeing it as – strategically if you think about the NTAP, it would be an accelerator right to adoption. Because if you had some additional reimbursement on the Pure-Vu sleeve in the hospital environment, I think it would allow us to work through the value analysis committee, financial analysis much easier, you know because it's reducing obviously the overall cost burden."
2656,en,1,384,1,0.671852,positive,1,positive,0.467989,"But keep in mind that today on an individual patient basis, individual procedure, we're showing a return on the investment you know with one sleeve. So this would just, you know as I said serve as more of an accelerator if you will. So I don't see it having any anything but positive upside to you know revenue uptake and obviously we wouldn't change our pricing based on that either."

I mean you mentioned the REDUCE study, which was going to be an open label registry, which we did back when we did our cost cutting last year. We did put that study in the back burner, and so right now we're focused on the Cleveland Clinic study that we talked about earlier, and those patients in the ICU."
2663,en,1,625,1,-0.656223,negative,,negative,-0.646641,"And then we are initiating a small study also in Europe and we’re going to see some of the key thought leaders there and that study is really focused on patients that have – it’s called a difficulty in prepping in the outpatient scenario and are typically coming back almost on a yearly basis, because they never got a good example. The physician that are examining them constantly just to make sure that whatever calls they missed on the prior procedure hopefully as they get larger, they will catch them before they become cancerous problems. So we will be initiating that study coming up in the next quarter or so as well."
2664,en,1,402,1,0.438155,positive,1,positive,0.582167,"So again, it'll be an interesting population, because that will also feed into some of the issues in the out-patient in the U.S. for these patient that are on a reduced surveillance interval, because they don't get a good preparation and there's concern of an inevitable cancer. So it’s a nice way for us to get some early data on that, as well as see some of the key thought leaders in Europe as well."

I would say Boobalan right now, if we kind of think about COVID and access, there is about – I’ll call it about two-thirds of those that are active. We expect the others to kind of pick back up."
2669,en,1,457,1,0.67199,positive,1,positive,0.658776,"We are working with as I said earlier, a very lean commercial team. So we are remaining very focused on targets that have the highest potential to close. The most quickly and also kind of play a strategic role in the overall foundation setting that we are doing and I would say that’s the mode that we are in here as you know. And I think had we not lost a handful of quarters with COVID, we would have probably been you know through that and further along."
2670,en,1,485,1,0.835237,positive,,positive,0.908975,"But we'll continue to strategically add new sites I would say each and every quarter as we just did, as we reported in Q4 and we're continuing here in Q1, but we're going to do it smart. And as we as we look at 2021, we will also think about where we’ll expand the commercial organization in targeted geographies that we believe the ROI will be there, and that will allow it to accelerate, bringing on additional sites as well.

Reduction in net debt by $368 million compared with March of 2019. 1 priority was to maintain the safety of our employees and our customers during this pandemic. Continue to invest in our business. Again, we won innovation awards in print and digital packaging business. The customer-first model, the One Kodak model, this approach is clearly paying off for us. Materially fixed our balance sheet and financial foundation. We've been talking about that for a couple of years. Let's fix the foundation. Let's get hold of our debt. Let's find a path forward.

This control weakness did not result in the misstatement of any current or prior period financial statements. The company has remediated these control deficiencies as of December 31, 2020. Documentation and supervisory review controls around master data were strengthened, and an audit trail of stock-based compensation award additions and modifications performed by the service provider is now being maintained.

Revenue -- now, 2020 is a year plagued by COVID-19 and also the more significant is oil price drop that affects Husky Oil in a material way. And so this -- all these result has been taken into account of all this problem, and you will see that revenue, the total group dropped 8% and EBITDA dropped 13% and EBIT should drop 24%."
2759,en,1,115,1,-0.327796,negative,,negative,-0.299937,"And our earnings, minus 27%. And net earning per share at $7.56, minus 27% and correspondingly, [EPS] is minus 27%."
2760,en,1,548,1,0.32034,positive,1,positive,0.462269,"But however, because of -- we have -- the operation has been operated very tight and then we have some mega transaction come through, and then the debt ratio has dropped from 25% last year to 22%. So that we can see that this is a very excellent result because what happened at the oil front is so difficult, and the figure come through negative against us. It is so bad, but thanks to the VHA deal that we merged with TPG and thanks for the tower deal. And then we actually generate enough profit to overcome the mega losses incurred by Husky Oil."
2761,en,1,419,1,0.805594,positive,1,positive,0.449971,"And also during this year, we also fixed Husky which we will go into more detail by merging with Cenovus as the end result is a much better animal. And if you look at the -- today, when we merged with -- we were about $3, and then now Cenovus is over $10. And then if you go back to what we own in Husky, the [equipment] is about $8.50. So the result of the merger gives us a lot of hope and then we are [Indiscernible]"
2762,en,1,522,1,0.26458,positive,1,positive,0.258467,"If you go to Page 5, okay, give you the EBITDA because Husky Oil order country and percentage changes. If you see that instead of 1 circle, we now have 2 circles. One is the outer one is the actual [auditors] because Husky suddenly become negative. So that every other thing become bigger. And then the inner one -- the outer one is the actual one then the inner one is the were set right count and if you look at the graph, the chart on the right-hand side you saw that -- you saw the waterfall of how the EBITDA dropped."
2763,en,1,86,1,-0.30096,negative,,negative,-0.30096,So we go from 2019 underlying EBITDA and then the part basically dropped $2.5 billion.
2764,en,1,401,1,0.609323,positive,1,positive,0.577019,"Actually, it's mostly came from last year as first half and the second half is structured much less, and it went to the fourth quarter. Actually, it is quite a good performance. And the same thing is on the retail and then the retail is also suffered by the first half when the whole business dropped 50%. But then the second half was doing quite good. Actually, second half was better than last year."
2765,en,1,113,1,-0.745909,negative,,negative,-0.601248,"This is why. So the retail -- so as a whole year, it only dropped $1.8 billion. It's mostly come from first half."
2766,en,1,188,1,-0.466945,negative,,negative,-0.603116,And then the interest structure doesn't really affect the -- by the COVID-19 so it's doing -- it shows a green color. And Husky is the big casualty and which we will describe to you later.
2767,en,1,681,1,0.602349,positive,1,positive,0.583813,"And then the telephone group is basically -- although it showed the HKD 3.3 billion negative is actually is doing quite good. Actually, if you look at the underlying performance, it's similar to last year. So what happened is that this -- there was a nonrecurring item or onetime item happened last year, which is a $1 billion happen in Italy when we shift some compensation from some vendor and then about $1.2 billion in -- from the 3 U.K., where we got some compensation -- some benefit from the VAT. And then there was $1 billion from the corporate side, where there some adjustment came through. Actually from the operations [Indiscernible] you will see later is quite stable."

So on the head office front, I would -- basically the interest, I will let Frank talk more to it, okay? So this year, you will see that most of the -- majority of the income come from Europe and Hong Kong become more enough because of the Husky Oil doesn't contribute anything."

2771,en,1,594,1,0.530906,positive,1,positive,0.479976,"The first sort of easy snapshot of what the cash flow profile of the group was like. So operating cash flow is just a very quick proxy. It's EBITDA from our subsidiaries plus distributions from our associates less CapEx and investments. And so obviously, on that measure, we had a meaningful decline from 2019, right? And you see that in the bars, basically, the result for this year at $39.8 billion is the -- what you get by subtracting $69.6 billion -- sorry, $29.7 billion from $69.6 billion on the columns on the right. And the distribution of that obviously speaks pretty well for itself."
2772,en,1,649,1,0.55302,positive,1,positive,0.478897,"Interestingly, though, this rough measure tells a lot less of the story this year. So if we go very quickly to the next slide, the -- there's really no important number on Slide 7. There's really no important message just to convey here, except that, essentially, everybody is living within their means. And in fact, everybody is living within CapEx and investment envelopes that are less than depreciation except, right, in the telecoms group and in HAT, where we are still in a meaningful investment phase. But obviously, the message is even on the operating free cash flow measure, right, we're very well covered in terms of our spending profile."
2773,en,1,416,1,0.458078,positive,,positive,0.820753,"The next page, Page 8, is actually quite a little bit more interesting this year because it looks at the whole free cash flow picture. And when you do that, you obviously have to take into account of what's happening to interest expenses and financing costs. You have to take account of what's happening in taxes. And you have to take account of what's happening in working capital. So it's a slightly complex chart."
2774,en,1,209,1,0.837744,positive,,positive,0.837744,"But to simplify it, if you go to the right-hand side, right, last year's free cash flow, underlying free cash flow after tax, after working capital movements, after financing cost, et cetera was $21.7 billion."
2775,en,1,418,1,0.3285,positive,1,positive,0.373784,"Now we've just gone through the reduction in EBITDA that we suffered, right, during the year of $10.9 billion, but we recovered significantly more than that, right, in terms of the, believe it or not, overall level of dividends that we received from our associates excluding Husky Energy, of course. But interest and financing costs and taxes paid were down very significantly. So in the aggregate, by HKD 6.1 billion."
2776,en,1,383,1,0.813112,positive,,positive,0.892704,"And working capital was managed very, very tightly all around from the group. I have to, in particular, single out the retail division, right, for their excellent job in managing working capital over the course of the year. So the swing from year-to-year is $9 billion. So the free cash flow underlying profile for 2020 is $27.9 billion, right, which is fully $6 billion-plus better."
2777,en,1,92,1,0.967648,positive,,positive,0.967648,"And obviously, I think a very encouraging picture in terms of the group's financial profile."
2778,en,1,372,1,0.602861,positive,1,positive,0.581288,"If we go to the next page, right? This is this is Page 9. The group's financial profile, not surprisingly, after everything that I've just said, right, is still very strong. Net debt, as we said, has reduced, has reduced substantially in absolute dollars and has continued actually to -- we've been continuing to reduce gross debt right in the first 2 months of this year."

One of the things that works against us there is the movement in sterling and euros, right, over year-on-year, which increases net debt. And as a result, negatively affects the ratio. So you could argue that on a like-for-like basis that the ratio is a little bit better than that."
2780,en,1,169,1,0.941475,positive,,positive,0.877793,Our ratings stayed stable. Our weighted average maturity at 4.7 years is very manageable. We are still further down in terms of the average cost of debt capital at 1.7%.

We were 33% last year and 67% fixed. So we've been taking some advantage of moving out along the curve a bit, right, as we medium- longer-term rates, obviously, have been at historic lows."

And CKI, of course, will report that they redeemed the perpetual of $1.2 billion right, in full, right, in February, I believe so."
2783,en,1,112,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.664485,I think that's all I have to say about the overall financial profile. And the next section is ports. So Canning?
2784,en,1,11,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Canning Fok
2785,en,1,255,1,0.495861,positive,1,positive,0.450171,Okay. Yes. The ports this year is a difficult year in the first half because of the China shutdown and then towards the middle of the year is the European shutdown. But then it really recovered well towards the end of the year. So that is the whole story.
2786,en,1,165,1,0.829758,positive,,positive,0.699468,"So that we still -- our asset is USD 11 billion and then 283 berths and 52 ports in 26 countries. And last year, we handled 83.7 million TEU, which is 3% below 2019."
2787,en,1,431,1,-0.416001,negative,1,positive,0.323822,"And then the EBITDA is $10 billion -- almost $11 billion and 19% of 2019. And if you look at, basically, if you will look at the waterfall chart from 2019 to 2020, you will see that actually, if you look at the first red is the main line and so basically it's all come from because in the first half we reduced Shanghai by 20%, so that the reduction mainly comes from the reductions of interest. It's not really from the operation."
2788,en,1,445,1,0.736555,positive,,positive,0.708861,"And then if you saw a bigger figure, $1.3 billion from Asia, Australia and all those. One of the major big is about $600 million and then come from the close of the [Dan] mine and then we provide, if you take the opportunity to provide some of the middle -- small Middle East port. And so that there is about $600 million. And then another $200 million from -- if you compare to last year, demand because we finished the concession in September."
2789,en,1,450,1,-0.36935,negative,1,negative,-0.415127,"So that if you take that away, the other is a small drop. So that actually it was better in the second half already. And then the corporate is at 400 -- almost $500 million, it's basically the dividend from OOCL, which we had last year, we don't have this year. So the ports this year have a difficult time, but they hold, they fought pretty well. And then about the September -- August, September onwards, actually, the throughput start coming back."
2790,en,1,69,1,0.866344,positive,,positive,0.866344,And then we still see a strong throughput growth until now this year.
2791,en,1,389,1,0.934799,positive,,positive,0.828837,"If you go to Page 11 somebody move the page in the screen. And so that shows you the monthly throughput. And if you look at that, the trust is all -- the green is about 2019. And you can see that all for the main trust Mainland, Europe and Asia, Australia, if you show -- it shows that in Asia and then after June, they are all doing quite well. And then in Mainland, it is the same thing."
2792,en,1,326,1,0.846545,positive,,positive,0.85419,"In Europe, actually, it is getting better and better in the summer. And then it's getting better in the last 2 months and the same as in the other Asian and Australian ports. So that the story is that -- is coming back, the stories. And then we see strong performance in January and February and also March up to today, right?"
2793,en,1,181,1,0.717376,positive,,positive,0.650008,"Page 12, let's go to the famous retail. I think we got Dominic here. He is not only a head office [Director], but he also is the CEO of Watson. So I will invite him to talk Page 12."

2795,en,1,194,1,0.988452,positive,,positive,0.890301,"Okay. Well, thank you, Canning. And I'm sure all of you will be interested and anxious to know what the retail division have -- was doing last year and also into the first 2 months of this year."
2796,en,1,312,1,0.604542,positive,,positive,0.545529,"But before commenting on the slides that follow, I would like to pass on the following messages so that to put things into the right perspective. 2020 was a testing year for all retailers in the world and A.S. Watson has proven to be resilient versus competition, with total sales dropping only 5.7% versus 2019."
2797,en,1,192,1,0.88229,positive,,positive,0.952542,"The first half of the year was very challenging with massive store closures, especially in China. But then we have a very robust recovery in the second half, both in terms of sales and profit."
2798,en,1,714,1,0.67806,positive,,positive,0.745978,"To illustrate, EBITDA in the second half increased significantly by 111% when compared to the first half. And like what Canning said, 12% increase over the same period second half of 2019. This was helped by large -- by the large loyalty member base and an acceleration in our digital transformation. At the same time, the O+O strategy, i.e., offline plus online, has enabled us to significantly increase our digital sales by leveraging our physical store network. So the physical stores actually helped the e-commerce side. So as a result, the e-commerce sales increased over 90% in 2020. And to update you on the last -- in the first 2 months of this year, EBITDA and EBIT has already returned to the 2019 level."
2799,en,1,353,1,0.753839,positive,,positive,0.774738,"So now let's go to the slide. So this gives you an overall perspective of how the retail division was doing last year. Some corporate information on the left. The retail division is the world's largest international health and beauty retailer, operating in 27 markets with 139 loyalty members worldwide. One of the largest loyalty programs in the world."
2800,en,1,81,1,0.862047,positive,,positive,0.862047,"And more importantly, 65% of our total sales actually came from this member base."
2801,en,1,380,1,0.538452,positive,1,positive,0.421919,"Our exclusive sales participation reached 35% of total sales creating a lot of uniqueness and differentiation. The business strategy for the past few years has been focusing on O+O, off-line plus online. It's a new terminology that I want to elaborate. In fact, it leverages on our extensive network and also our CRM member base. The reason for this O+O strategy is quite obvious."
2802,en,1,252,1,0.488623,positive,,positive,0.640116,"Because our data analysis shows that an average O+O customer, i.e., a customer who buys both off-line and online, spend 3x as much as they spend by customers who only shop in physical stores. So there's huge sales upside potential for us going forward."
2803,en,1,187,1,0.943177,positive,,positive,0.943177,"And if you want to understand more under this very important O+O strategy, Malina Ngai, the Chief Operating Officer of Retail, would be very happy to elaborate for you in the Q&A session."
2804,en,1,506,1,-0.621635,negative,,negative,-0.578136,"On store numbers, the division has 16,167 stores at year-end, an increase of 2%. 50% of the stores are in Asia and 50% in Europe. In terms of EBITDA, despite the tough trading environment marked by store closures and reduced footfall, EBITDA only dropped 15% or 16% in local currency to $14.4 billion. Moreover, if you exclude a onetime dilution gain of $633 million recognized in 2019 as a result of a merger between the partnership of China and Yonghui of China, the EBITDA decrease is even lower at 11%."
2805,en,1,85,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"So the underlying EBITDA decrease is only 11%. But reportedly, 16% in local currency."
2806,en,1,433,1,0.738796,positive,,positive,0.650038,"In terms of the split, 48% of the EBITDA is in Asia and 52% in Europe. On EBITDA growth, the waterfall chart on the right shows decreases in all divisions, except other retail, the green block, which shows a $1.1 billion increase. This represents a strong performance of PARKnSHOP, the supermarket chain; as well as Fortress, the electrical retail chain in Hong Kong and strong performance in the Watsons water and beverage division."
2807,en,1,304,1,0.971538,positive,,positive,0.971538,"On the other hand, the health and beauty business had a total EBITDA decrease of 20%, around $3.1 billion, attributed by a decrease of $1.77 billion in health and beauty China, followed by $628 million decrease in health and beauty Asia, $553 million in Western Europe and $190 million in Eastern Europe."
2808,en,1,419,1,0.77645,positive,,positive,0.875746,"Noteworthy is that the EBITDA decreases in health and beauty mainly took place in the first half of the year, as Canning mentioned, as also the Chairman mentioned when it dropped 44%. But since then, we saw a very strong recovery in the second half when we witnessed even a small positive growth of 0.3%. So net-net, the total EBITDA for the year is $14.4 billion, which includes an FX translation gain of $161 million."
2809,en,1,496,1,0.366859,positive,1,positive,0.395971,"For EBITDA margin percentage, it's worth mentioning in the lower right-hand table as a result of decreases in EBITDA dollar, the EBITDA margin percentage of the various health and beauty divisions were also adversely affected. Health and beauty China saw a 4 percentage points drop from 18% to 14% whereas the other divisions dropped 1 percentage point. The wider margin percentage decrease in China is due to the significant drop in EBITDA, as aforementioned, as well as a shift in category mix."
2810,en,1,319,1,0.572948,positive,1,positive,0.523276,"What I mean by category mix is that under the epidemic, we saw less consumption of the higher-margin skin care and cosmetic products, while consumption of the lower margin personal and body care products were still in demand. So we believe this is reversible post COVID, and we are seeing it happening in recent months."
2811,en,1,308,1,0.825618,positive,,positive,0.821367,"Next slide, Slide 13. And in fact, the next 2 slides shows the quarterly sales changes and their respective health and beauty divisions during the year. The blocks in the middle illustrate the quarterly EBITDA change year-on-year, and the charts underneath simply illustrated temporary store closure profile."
2812,en,1,866,1,0.338549,positive,1,positive,0.506152,"First, for the health and beauty China chart on the left, we can see the biggest sales decrease was in Q1 when the sales dropped 78% in February with over 2,500 temporary store closures. With the closed stores gradually be opened in subsequent months, we can see from the graph that the negative sales growth improved. Also worth mentioning is that the sales reduction is smaller than the stores traffic reduction, which is illustrated by the red dotted line underneath the sales change graph. This was the result of increases in customer conversion rates and higher average transaction -- transaction value so that the sales decrease is lower than the traffic decrease. Overall, the total sales decrease for the year is 19%, with first half decrease of 26%, improving to 11% in the second half. So we have a tough first half but recovered nicely in the second half."
2813,en,1,830,1,0.51855,positive,1,positive,0.619425,"Correspondingly, as shown in the red box in the middle, the EBITDA dropped 62% in the first half and narrowed to only 13% in the second half with total EBITDA decrease of 39% for the year. Nonetheless, the silver lining is that there's a rapid proliferation of online sales, which increased 123% year-on-year. The increase in online sales was held by the milestone initiative, which I mentioned last year during the internal results, whereby our 28,000 plus store staff remained connected with our loyalty members through the WeChat enterprise app to retain sales. So even during the close downs, during the pandemic, our customers are still engaged with our 28,000-odd store staff or sales agents and beauty advisers. So O+O participation has reached at 35%, China got the highest O+O sales participation within the retail group."
2814,en,1,640,1,0.613946,positive,1,positive,0.620657,"Now next for health and beauty Asia. We see a sharp decrease of around 30% in Q2 as a result of store closures in a number of countries in April. Overall, the sales decrease for the year is 16%, with first half decrease of 17%, improving to 14% in the second half. So on EBITDA, I must point out that Hong Kong had a major adverse impact on the division's EBITDA, with a sharp decrease of [indiscernible] tourist arrivals due to the border closures, our Hong Kong Watson stores located in tourist areas were severely impacted. But on a more positive note, excluding these tourist stores, the rest of the portfolio is healthy and profitable."
2815,en,1,612,1,0.530103,positive,1,positive,0.472902,"And the tourist stores are being turning around with encouraging initial results that we see recently. Overall, the Asia division managed to narrow its year-on-year EBITDA decline from 39% in the first half to only 3% in the second half. So on a country basis, Malaysia, Thailand were doing better and leading the recovery with 2020 full year sales, matching that of 2019. So Malaysia, Thailand, these contributed to maintain the sales versus 2019. Philippines still suffer from a prolonged period of quarantine in key cities. And lastly, for the health and beauty Asia division, the online sales growth is 101%."
2816,en,1,535,1,0.763236,positive,,positive,0.761871,"So next slide, Slide 14. Similar chart for Western Europe and Eastern Europe, okay? Now first, on Western Europe. Well, Western Europe is like a tale of 2 cities. In the Netherlands and Germany, all of our health and beauty stores remain open during the lock down because they are deemed essential retail. Both countries, Netherlands and Germany saw positive sales and positive EBITDA growth during the year because the stores are located in suburban areas and close to supermarkets where the footfalls were not much affected by COVID."
2817,en,1,471,1,0.746039,positive,,positive,0.808239,"Whereas in U.K., although our health and beauty stores also remain open, but they are more located in the high suites and shopping malls where footfall drops was both apparent. So as a result, both sales and EBITDA in U.K. declined significantly versus 2019. However, we are confident that when the lockdown measures start to ease, which is now with the vaccination program, the U.K. business are poised for a robust recovery this year, and we are very confident of that."
2818,en,1,499,1,0.686819,positive,,positive,0.665092,"So on the luxury business, while the health and beauty stores were being open, the perfumery, the luxury business, although located in the same countries, for example, the Netherlands, the product is open but the [Indiscernible] luxury business has to be closed because they are deemed nonessential. So net-net, with all these counterbalancing factors, the total sales for the year in Western Europe only dropped 3% overall, 5% in the first half and recovered strongly to only 1% in the second half."
2819,en,1,326,1,0.577832,positive,,positive,0.86653,"So likewise, for EBITDA, we see a very strong recovery in the second half by turning around a year-on-year reduction of 39% in the first half to a growth of 14% in the second half. So as a result, total EBITDA decrease for the year is only 9%. And online sales for this division has recorded a healthy 70% growth year-on-year."
2820,en,1,473,1,0.861545,positive,,positive,0.967166,"So last, we turn to the Eastern Europe chart. So overall, the total sales of Eastern Europe remained flat at the same level as 2019. With 2% drop in the first half and compensated by 2% growth in the second half. So 2% drop first half, 2% increase in second half. And the sales and EBITDA profile of Eastern Europe actually is dominated by Poland, where they had a 24% EBITDA drop in the first half, but a robust recovery to positive EBITDA growth of 3% in the second half."
2821,en,1,132,1,0.50204,positive,,positive,0.908071,So total EBITDA decrease for this division is limited to only 9%. So online sales growth for the division is also very good at 108%.
2822,en,1,487,1,0.936665,positive,,positive,0.901923,"So in summary, we have looked at various divisions, Asia, China, Western Europe, Eastern Europe. But overall, the retail division has shown a high degree of resilience, attributed to its well balanced and well-diversified portfolio and the online capability actually have benefited and quickly improved during the pandemic year in support of our successful O+O strategy. So this is a very quick summary of retail happening last year. And I now pass back to Canning on the infrastructure."
2823,en,1,10,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Frank Sixt
2824,en,1,364,1,-0.253927,negative,1,negative,-0.22686,"Yes. I don't think we need to dwell on it. I'm sure CKI will have reported in detail what the drivers were, right, of its earnings reduction in 2020. A couple of anomalies. One is some meaningful COVID events effects, somewhere in the area of HKD 600 million from assets like PARKnFLY in Canada, where obviously nobody was flying and therefore, nobody was parking."
2825,en,1,341,1,-0.609262,negative,,negative,-0.764559,"In addition, there was a very major accounting volatility relating to deferred taxes, right, which resulted in a charge of HKD 1.4 billion because of a 2% increase in the tax rate in the U.K. that was announced during the course of 2020. That's quite problematic, right, because it's not a real cash volatility or even a real cash flow risk."
2826,en,1,482,1,-0.738545,negative,,negative,-0.810068,"Most of the regulated assets have, in effect, a pass-through of the actual cash tax burden that is paid out in any given year by the regulated utilities. So this anomaly, of course, grows larger with the increase in 2021 with the proposed increase in tax rates that we're expecting somewhere in the U.K., which would go up by 6%, and it's something that we'll be looking very closely at because it's becoming a very distorting earnings volatility with no real meaning in cash terms."
2827,en,1,589,1,-0.448096,negative,1,negative,-0.415876,"Other than that, there are some headwinds in the business in terms of regulatory resets. We all know that. Regulatory resets are tending in one direction, which is not that surprising, given how far long-term interest rates have dropped all around the world. The timetable on the lower right sort of sets out what is to be reset during which periods, and it will be what it will be. Needless to say, in value terms, at the same low interest rate environment that's driving the regulatory reset environment is probably also supportive of the valuation environment for infrastructure assets."
2828,en,1,61,1,0.784241,positive,,positive,0.784241,So we'll have to see where all those puts and takes take you.

2833,en,1,594,1,0.290268,positive,1,negative,-0.397449,"Thank you. Okay. So Slide 16, I'm not going to dwell on the Husky debacle. I mean what happens when all of the commodity price supporting your production goes through the floor and goes way below your cash breakeven level, let alone your earnings breakeven level and you combine that with effectively a collapse in the markets for refined products largely due to the collapse in demand for jet fuel. And you have an unprecedented Armageddon, and you get the kind of net loss profile, which is shown on this slide, which wax CKHH, whichever line you choose to look at, was an unprecedented loss."
2834,en,1,279,1,0.307081,positive,,positive,0.480321,"Now interestingly, it is a noncash loss in the sense that Husky only paid us a relatively small dividend. So in terms of this impact on our cash and our financial profile relatively low, but it is indicative of a pretty significant value loss in Husky, and you can't ignore that."
2835,en,1,531,1,0.845932,positive,,positive,0.79712,"Of course, we were fortunate and that we were able to agree and then in early January, complete a merger with Cenovus Energy. That merger, we've already talked about a little bit, but it creates not only one of the largest number 3 producer in Canada, but also one of the lowest-cost producers and one of the most integrated producers in North America, which is a superb place to be. What that translates into is a WTI breakeven, which is very significantly below where Husky is WTI breakeven might ever have been considered to be."
2836,en,1,909,1,0.6046,positive,1,positive,0.635495,"And as a result of that, in the current commodity price environment, which let us hope that it persists during the course of the year, we are probably experiencing netbacks that are more than double than what they would otherwise have been so in last year's price environment. So the good news there is that in terms of value creation, Cenovus is a company that does not need to incur exploration expenses in order to support its production profile and its reserve profile and a reasonable level of growth in its production. That being the case, most of the kind of cash flow that's being generated in this environment can go to debt reduction as can the realization of synergies, which have been targeted at a run rate in cash terms of CAD 1.2 billion a year as an exit rate coming out of this year. So you can see that, that potentially adds to the value of the equity position that we have very materially."
2837,en,1,546,1,0.88162,positive,,positive,0.864533,"Just to go over that very quickly. We actually hold a number of warrants in addition to our shares. So on a fully diluted basis, our interest is 16.79%. The warrants are at $6.50 strike price, they have a 5-year term. So they are very valuable little pieces of paper right now. Canning mentioned that we've experienced a terrific recovery in value already. So for our 16.79%, that's a CAD 3.5 billion gain from the Husky low point, which was at around $3 a share. So it is -- as mergers go, so far, we're very happy because it's almost a 3x here."
2838,en,1,65,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,So I think I'll stop there and hand back to Canning for telecoms.

2840,en,1,261,1,0.663127,positive,,positive,0.696913,Okay. So much for Husky. And I think the combined animal is a much better animal than Husky standalone. Similar production of oil quantities but at a much higher quality and much lower cost. So that I think we should be able to take advantage of this situation.
2841,en,1,376,1,0.527586,positive,1,positive,0.289504,"Now let's go to Page 17 on telecommunications. So that the way -- so that this company had total revenue of $85 billion revenue, but then it dropped about 3% in local currency. And of course, during the COVID period, which is couple most of the time, a lot of the time in Europe in various times. And the gross add is -- has dropped. But however, the trend is also doing good."
2842,en,1,353,1,0.279737,positive,1,positive,0.312446,"And then of course, the one thing that we miss out is a reduction in the roaming income, okay? So that our customer base is 38.5 million, so down 5% and our -- but then our ARPU is getting better because people stay home and I suppose they have nothing to do, and then they spend more time on the phone. And of course, you can see the usage is 35% more."
2843,en,1,662,1,0.722731,positive,,positive,0.790231,"And then during last year, we actually do a lot of things on 5G. And you just be [indiscernible] of the 5G capability, we start rolling out everywhere. And then as the Chairman pointed out in the press conference, actually, we just got hold of 2 10 megahertz of -- of 700 at a price which is almost 50% of what we paid for the last time around, which is very good. And in fact, I just want to say that it's the first time in our career, our U.K. spectrum position is more than competitive than the others. Our 5G, 3.5, 5 is much more than our competitor. And then the first time that we have 10 megahertz of lower spectrum at 700, which is very, very good to us."
2844,en,1,485,1,0.759069,positive,,positive,0.682091,"So if you look at the right-hand side, the middle of the slide, and then you see the waterfall chart. And I think, basically, it's just summarize what I said, take away the one-off or nonrecurring one, actually the business is similar to last year. So this group holding very well. And then actually, the slight red in U.K., you can just say that is because of the cost in holding the 5G spectrum. And we have to pay a spectrum fee, and this amount was more than what we did last year."
2845,en,1,311,1,0.636057,positive,,positive,0.887412,"And if you -- so EBITDA margin is more -- U.K. is always still in a work in progress but has improving. And then the margin other than U.K. is more almost dropped. It's quite good Italy, 46%; Sweden, 47%; Austria, 51%, even Ireland 43%.

And what we recorded is a gain of HKD 16.6 billion in the year. The remainder of the aggregate $10 billion of consideration comes in this year in 2021. That's already started with the completion of the sale in Sweden in January. But of course, the 2 biggest sales remain to be completed. That's the towers in Italy and the tower assets in the U.K., including the lion's share of the build-to-suit program, which falls in the U.K. That we anticipate will bring in additional proceeds of $73.1 billion and an additional gain in 2021 of $50.8 billion."

But because of the impairment of deferred tax charges, earnings is down. But if you look closely at the regulated business, the rules of the regulation allow the operator to collect the increase -- the difference in the increase in tax in future years. So actually, there's no destruction of value when the tax rate goes up, but because we abide by accounting rule, we will have to take a hit now, but we have a higher reported profit in later years which is confusing to some people, but the accounting rule is that way."

2972,en,1,475,1,0.288283,positive,1,positive,0.45117,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work during a very difficult but very successful restructuring process. A year ago, Extraction had 323 employees. Today, we have 121. With regret but out of necessity, we reduced our headcount by 62% in 2020. We miss those folks and we sincerely appreciate the hard work turned in by our current staff who picked up the slack as we emerged from Chapter 11 this past January."
2973,en,1,755,1,0.286492,positive,1,positive,0.551815,"Our restructuring process was difficult but it's also positioned us for success in the current environment. Our streamlined staffing has increased efficiency and collaboration even during the pandemic and contributed to a reduction in cash G&A of nearly 50%. We equitized $1.3 billion in unsecured debt and preferred equity. We reduced our RBL borrowings from $600 million to the $254 million that's currently drawn under our revolver. We reduced our D&C and LOE costs by over 20%. Our run rate, transportation and gathering expenses have declined by approximately 50% through the renegotiation of 7 of our key midstream and marketing contracts. And we eliminated the vast majority of our midstream minimum volume commitments as part of that same process."
2974,en,1,570,1,0.701183,positive,,positive,0.671399,"One thing that didn't change during the restructuring is the quality of our property base, both in terms of geology and concentration. Our year-end total proved PV-10 value was $1.4 billion using March 1 strip pricing, and our PDP PV-10 was just under $1.2 billion. And today, for the first time in a long time, we have a balance sheet that complements the value of our asset base, with a straightforward capital structure comprised of common equity and our borrowing base facility, leverage of less than 1 times EBITDA and more than $250 million in available liquidity."
2975,en,1,467,1,0.961293,positive,,positive,0.965154,"As a company, we now have a new, highly engaged Board of Directors, and we've adopted a new business model, focused on returns over growth, low leverage, scale economics to be achieved through consolidation and the generation of material free cash flow. Specifically, with respect to our excess cash flow, we expect to fully repay our outstanding debt this year so we will be debt-free by year-end. And we hope to institute a dividend policy over the same time frame."
2976,en,1,465,1,0.606984,positive,,positive,0.678312,"From a governance perspective, we've implemented a new compensation structure. All of management's incentive compensation and 100% of our directors annual stipends are paid in Extraction common shares. And the vesting of the majority of the management team's incentive comp is contingent on absolute shareholder return. We are not aware of another compensation structure in the industry that has greater alignment with the performance of the company's common stock."
2977,en,1,383,1,0.694477,positive,,positive,0.694477,"At the Board level, we've also established the company's first ESG Committee as a follow-on to our corporate sustainability report, which is available for your review on our website. The company has undertaken a series of ESG initiatives, and you should look forward to an announcement in the near future that more specifically details our achievements and our strategy in this area."
2978,en,1,471,1,0.752139,positive,,positive,0.704792,"Taken together, our quality assets, low-cost structure, financial flexibility and continuing focus on responsible ESG policy enable Extraction to operate at the front end of the North American E&P curve. As always, we are focused first on safety in our operations. Financially, however, our strategy is generating significant cash returns, maintaining low leverage and initiating distributions to our shareholders, all while continuing to reduce our environmental impact."

2981,en,1,530,1,0.664926,positive,1,positive,0.653709,"Thanks, Tom. By way of update, after ceasing drilling and completion operations back in the second quarter of 2020, we still generated net sales volumes of 83,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which was 62% liquids. This year, we recommenced operations with 1 drilling rig on our Wake North pad and 1 completion crew on our GP pad, both in Greeley. We are preparing the GP pad to be turned in line during the second quarter, and the Wake North pad should begin production around the beginning of the third quarter."
2982,en,1,452,1,0.798294,positive,,positive,0.813458,"As Tom noted, we are prioritizing cash returns in all of our operations, and we expect to balance the allocation of our cash flow among reinvestment in our projects, debt reduction and distributions to shareholders. We have also made the strategic decision to up-space relative to our historical drilling strategies. We believe this is the optimal way to allocate capital and maximize returns through decreasing cycle times and improving per-well EURs."
2983,en,1,478,1,0.61177,positive,,positive,0.586162,"We have already begun this effort by completing 13 to 15 wells on the GP and Wake North pads, which were originally planned for 20 to 24 wells each. And on 1 of our pads in Windsor, we are drilling only the Codell formation as its economics are superior to the Niobrara. I wanted to highlight these first 3 pads in 2021 because they are concrete examples of how the company has shifted its development strategy with a rigorous focus on capital allocation and maximizing returns."
2984,en,1,39,1,0.771563,positive,,positive,0.771563,"With that, I think we're ready for Q&A."

Certainly seems like the balance sheet is well positioned for that. I think in the press release, you did talk about some leasehold acquisitions. But wanted to see if there's any other kind of chunkier deals that you may have your eyes on out there? I know there are still some distressed private operators out there in the DJ. Maybe you can just kind of talk about that strategy over time."

2991,en,1,883,1,0.587366,positive,1,positive,0.617576,"Yes, Leo, it's Tom. How are you doing this morning? I'd say 2 things. There is kind of a day-to-day optimization that we do in our assets, and those are largely cash transactions, whether they are sales of non-core assets or acquisitions of working interest to increase our ownership in our existing projects. And literally, we're considering those and executing those on a weekly basis. And then there are the strategic transactions. I would say at any one point in time, candidly, we're in dialogue with 1 or more parties about the possibility of transacting. And that, I would say that the majority of those are equity-based transactions. And I also don't think that the mode that we are in is materially different than the mode of others in the basin and others in the industry. So I would say it's a stated part of our strategy to consolidate and we're pursuing it aggressively."

2993,en,1,754,1,0.441387,positive,1,positive,0.376362,"Okay. And then just maybe jumping over to kind of the existing operations here. Obviously, you talked about a plan to kind of up-space with wider spacing. And just wanted to kind of get a sense when you sort of look at kind of current permits in hand across the company and kind of given the up space. What can you kind of tell us about the existing inventory, even if it's just kind of a high level number or XOG things that got 3 or 4 years of running room or whatever the number might be? And then maybe to kind of add on that, what's the plan in terms of further negotiations with some of the local municipalities? And kind of where does that stand in terms of maybe adding new operator agreements or expanding existing ones on the acreage footprint?"

2995,en,1,426,1,0.785683,positive,,positive,0.786482,"Leo, this is Matt. You're right, we have really looked at our inventory with an up-spacing perspective, focusing on returns. We have some slides on that in our presentation that illustrates how we view it. But up-space count that the company has is that 432 locations, and that was based off of when we did our original guidance. But as you can tell from the Slide 13 in our deck, that obviously changes with commodity prices."
2996,en,1,710,1,0.56172,positive,1,positive,0.578871,"But right now, we're comfortable with where the strip is at, that we have about 430 up-space locations remaining, which at our current rig pace and the fact that we drill mostly 2-mile-or-longer wells would be about 8 years of inventory. And as far as the other municipal operator agreements go, we don't have any new ones that we're currently working on. There are some that will be in the pipe shortly but they're not anywhere near the size and scale of some of the ones that we've executed in the past such as Commerce City or Broomfield with -- in terms of well counts. But we will continue adding small operator agreements to finish developing our acreage around the edges of some of those municipalities."

3000,en,1,508,1,0.591973,positive,1,positive,0.560333,"Just one housekeeping item. In the disclosure statement, I recall there being a pretty sizable working capital true-up that needed to be paid this year and in the $100-plus million range. And I saw your free cash flow guidance slide looks quite robust and you're going to end the year with no net debt. Is that -- was that working capital, which I thought was -- maybe some chunk of it was by the tax payments? Has that been kicked to a future year or was it overestimated? Or what exactly is going on there?"

3002,en,1,459,1,0.417097,positive,1,positive,0.471293,"Hey, Patrick, this is Marianella. Thanks for joining the call. I would say we -- that -- if you look at Page 7 in our presentation, we gave a $200 million working capital deficit. The year-end number, since we were still in bankruptcy as of year-end, is a little bit noisy. We do have, to your point, fairly large tax statements that we have made and will continue to make through April. Come April, there will be a more normal course working capital deficit."
3003,en,1,271,1,0.720227,positive,,positive,0.790933,"If you look at Page 7, we have made and we'll continue to make payments and working capital will tighten by about $60 million. And going forward, given our new production and the new commodity price environment, that should be our run rate production taxes going forward."

3007,en,1,611,1,0.506019,positive,1,positive,0.571222,"Absolutely. It's all in. And we merged with -- that there was about 3 chunks of production taxes we made in January, February, March. The 1 in April is just a normal course annual tax payment. So really, the delinquent property taxes that we did not pay before bankruptcy were all paid through this month. And in April, we'll have another large bill. But like I said, that's equivalent to much higher commodity price and much higher production than we saw in 2019. And so once April is behind us, you'll see that more normal course. But yes, the free cash flow guidance is all in after working capital payments."

3011,en,1,176,1,0.616145,positive,,positive,0.517764,"A question. Tom, can you talk philosophically about the reinvestment rate that you plan for the business in the context of dividend and generating free cash flow out into 2022?"
3012,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Thomas Tyree
3013,en,1,554,1,0.718599,positive,,positive,0.722284,"Sure. How are you doing, Jeff? Thanks for the question. First of all, I don't think we consider ourselves beholden to any set percent of cash flow going in any 1 direction, other than to say that we want to direct our cash flow every year to reinvestment in our projects, to debt repayment and to shareholder distributions. Those latter 2, I think the choice will become much more current for us towards the end of the year, certainly second half of the year, probably the fourth quarter after we are in a position where we've paid down most of our debt."
3014,en,1,530,1,0.628683,positive,,positive,0.619388,"And what we're weighing is distributions to shareholders versus reinvestment. Any given quarter, the things that factor into it are economic inventory and commodity prices and our dividend policy, which is yet to be determined. But we are -- I think we are set on imposing on ourselves a distribution policy that deals with, on the 1 hand, delevering, and on the other hand, returning cash to our shareholders and doing that on a continuous basis once we get our leverage down a little bit further. Does that answer your question?"

3016,en,1,202,1,0.690483,positive,,positive,0.53974,Yes. I guess what is part of what you're saying that you're going to instill discipline in the capital allocation process by how much you reinvest versus how much you potentially have for distributions?
3017,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Thomas Tyree
3018,en,1,324,1,0.876569,positive,,positive,0.884216,"Well, first of all, I would say our capital allocation process is already pretty darn disciplined. We've got a Board and a management team that are very, very focused on making sure that any investment we make in any of our projects is highly economic and is accretive to our return on capital employed on a corporate basis."
3019,en,1,534,1,-0.377505,negative,1,negative,-0.326937,"But I think the question you may be getting at is, when we sit around on a quarterly basis and decide how we're going to allocate capital, we are very rigorously going to look at the benefit of distributing cash to shareholders as an alternative. And that probably is different than past practices. I'd also say that it's hard to envision a scenario, even with commodity prices very high, where we would not allocate a material percentage of our cash flow to shareholder distributions or debt repayment, if it happens to be this year."

3021,en,1,304,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"A question, if I can follow up, maybe for Matt. On Slide 13, where you talk about the de-spacing, I think you said, Matt, that the current numbers are based on strip pricing. I'm just curious, how does the changes in prices and changes in costs, how does it affect the ideal spacing for your development?"

3023,en,1,453,1,-0.403281,negative,1,positive,0.304565,"Yes, you're correct. Page 13 is illustrative of how we kind of are looking at each development area in our inventory. Obviously, we're not going to make real-time changes based on weekly moves in the commodity price, but we're going to be more focused on what it looks like 12 to 24 months down the road. But if there is a long-term uplift in the strip or it's not backwardated as much, that could shift us to the right slightly on this plot on Page 13."
3024,en,1,437,1,0.773644,positive,,positive,0.737524,"But really, the main goal we're going for here is not necessarily maximizing our net present value, it's really maximizing the return on each incremental dollar we invest in the ground. So how much more CapEx or how much more NPV are we getting, net present value are we getting for each capital dollar that we're putting in the ground. And on this particular example that we're showing here, the limit is, in our minds, right around 12."

3028,en,1,368,1,0.538438,positive,,positive,0.508641,Jeff just asked my question about the spacing. A little more elaboration. It sounds like it was driven by incremental well economics as opposed to whatever was driving it in the past. Appears that other basin operators are doing similar things. How much does the spacing approach vary among your 3 or 4 large areas? How dispersed is the quality of your regional areas?

3030,en,1,478,1,0.630666,positive,,positive,0.673974,"Dave, thanks for the question. It does vary. On that same slide, there 13, you'll see in the first bullet point, we mentioned it's anywhere between 6 and 15 wells per section. And that really covers our acreage position in the core from the northern end in Windsor all the way down to the southern end in Hawkeye. For example, the lower end of that scale would be the acreage that we have in the Hawkeye Area. And the main reason for that is just the amount of formations there."
3031,en,1,535,1,0.865434,positive,,positive,0.859498,"So in Hawkeye, if you remember, the Codell formation is not present. It's a Niobrara only. So down there, we are looking at about 6 wells per section in the Niobrara. As you move north and you get into Broomfield, North Hawkeye, you get into Greeley, we have the Niobrara and the Codell formation there, so they both play in. And right now, the best economics that the company has is really the remaining pads we have in the Greeley area, and those will be the ones tipping the scale towards the upper end, around 15 wells per section."

I thought that Hawkeye required some meaningful infrastructure, midstream infrastructure spending before it's really ready to develop. Can you just speak to that order of magnitude of potential midstream requirements to get Hawkeye ready? Or is Hawkeye already all set?"

3039,en,1,481,1,0.389126,positive,1,positive,0.402586,"That's a good question. So when we first purchased the asset a couple of years ago, you're correct, there was very little midstream infrastructure down in the area, particularly for the gas processing, and there's actually no oil infrastructure in place at that time. Over the last couple of years, a large public company drilled some more wells down in that area, spread out across their position. It's since been purchased by a private operator who has continued the development."
3040,en,1,577,1,0.273681,positive,1,positive,0.248926,"But they have continued to expand their gathering infrastructure with respect to gas, and it covers most of their position, which is really the Western flank of our position. And we're not too far from the gathering infrastructure for the pads that we want to drill in the next few years. And then there's also an oil midstream company who has come down and started laying gathering lines. So while it's not as built out and robust as it is up in the Wattenberg Field, there is continuous expansion going on, both with the gas gathering and the oil gathering down in that area."

Joining me today from the management team of KindredBio are Wendy Wee, our CFO; and Katja Buhrer, our VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations."
3067,en,1,252,1,0.961622,positive,,positive,0.959821,"We are thrilled with our progress in the fourth quarter and in 2020 in general. We made excellent headway across our pipeline, including the initiation of the pivotal study for tirnovetmab and positive results on our inflammatory bowel disease program."
3068,en,1,243,1,0.81629,positive,,positive,0.81629,We also signed a partnership agreement with Elanco for our parvovirus antibody and expanded our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart. The successes in 2020 have set us up well for 2021 and we expect this year to be a better year for KindredBio.
3069,en,1,454,1,0.615453,positive,1,positive,0.536177,"Let me start with an update on our dermatitis franchise. We initiated the pivotal study for tirnovetmab in December of last year. It's too soon to tell how quickly it will enroll and our expectation that the study will take 12 to 18 months to complete hasn't changed. This is one of our flagship product candidates. And given that the canine dermatitis market has grown to nearly $1 billion a year, we would expect tirnovetmab to be extremely successful."
3070,en,1,298,1,0.26494,positive,1,neutral,0.0,"In addition, we are advancing our other candidates for dermatitis nicely, including our IL-4 receptor antibody. As a reminder, IL-4 our antibody targets the underlying disease itself instead of just the symptoms. So it could potentially have significant advantages over certain available therapies."
3071,en,1,350,1,0.764854,positive,,positive,0.766782,"We believe we have one of the broadest and most advanced dermatitis pipelines in the industry, including several molecules that have not had been disclosed. We have already incorporated our Half Life Extension technology into our dermatitis pipeline, and think long-acting molecules have the potential to be best-in-class and possibly market leaders."
3072,en,1,251,1,0.928861,positive,,positive,0.911385,"With the exception of the current incumbent, we estimate that we are ahead of our competition in this field, and we expect to be next to market with a molecule for this indication. So, we're very excited about our highly promising dermatitis pipeline."
3073,en,1,502,1,0.391883,positive,1,positive,0.501798,"Turning to the parvovirus program, we have reported compelling results from the prophylaxis pivotal study. The treatment pivotal study has been delayed longer than expected, but we expect results in the near future. We believe that this antibody has the potential to revolutionize the care of dogs and puppies with this devastating condition. There's a lot of excitement both within the company and outside about this program, which offers hope for what is a terrible and currently untreatable disease."
3074,en,1,372,1,0.846475,positive,,positive,0.863267,"We're very excited about our partnership with Elanco, which has one of the best commercial organizations in the industry. The terms of the partnership are very favorable, with milestones totaling over $100 million, as we previously announced. We also read out the results for the inflammatory bowel disease program at the end of last year, and the results were impressive."
3075,en,1,460,1,-0.268374,negative,,negative,-0.371498,"Complete remission was achieved in 75% of the TNF antibody group, compared to 17% in the placebo group. At day seven, the first post dose visits 75% of the treated dogs showed greater than 35% reduction in disease score compared to only 17% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 50% of the treated dogs achieved and maintain 100% reduction of disease score from baseline throughout all posts dose visits, whereas none of the placebo group achieved the same result"
3076,en,1,440,1,0.391929,positive,1,negative,-0.293507,"IBD and related disorders are very common, affecting over 5% of dogs. The market has many similarities to the atopic dermatitis market, before modern treatments are approved, including notable impact on the owners quality of life. We think it could rival the atopic dermatitis market in size. We have an exciting year ahead of us as we continue to advance our program, including multiple major readouts and potential approval of parvovirus."
3077,en,1,375,1,0.921492,positive,,positive,0.922287,"Turning to financials, which Wendy will discuss in more detail, we're pleased with the royalty revenue, which reflects the great work that our partner is doing. Dechra has done a terrific job of growing the market. And it is clear we partnered with the right company. In addition, we're also pleased with the revenue we're generating from our contract manufacturing business."
3078,en,1,450,1,0.71648,positive,,positive,0.685007,"The work is coming along well on our Vaxart partnership, and with the expansion of that partnership, we expect to realize about $20.5 million of revenue. We have also been awarded a contract from the National Cancer Institute, for manufacture of a human papillomavirus vaccine, which further validates our manufacturing capabilities. In order to qualify for contracts like this, the companies must undergo and pass a very rigorous evaluation process."
3079,en,1,291,1,0.666256,positive,1,positive,0.633436,"As you know, we have world-class manufacturing plants and personnel. This gives us a major competitive advantage and presents an opportunity to bring in non-dilutive capital for contract manufacturing. At the same time, our number one focus remains executing on our very attractive pipeline."
3080,en,1,245,1,0.997769,positive,,positive,0.934497,"We continue to be judicious with our spending, we were able to maintain our OpEx to approximately $10 million in Q4 and expect this level to remain fairly steady in 2021. The net takeaways are that we operate in a resilient and growing industry."
3081,en,1,215,1,0.917325,positive,1,positive,0.772463,We are amply capitalized. We're carefully managing our burn. We're making strong progress on high value potential blockbuster products. And we're executing well across the board. We're very excited about our future.

We begin 2021 with the right operational footprint, business model and extended cash runway to see our promising late stage programs through the final stages of development."

For the full year, the net - loss was $21.8 million or $0.55 per share, as compared to a net loss of $61.4 million or $1.59 per share in 2019. The variance relates to proceeds from the sale of Mirataz to Dechra, which was completed on April 15."

Full year revenues were $42.2 million compared to $4.3 million in 2019. Here again, the biggest component of the variance in the full year result was due to $38.7 million from the sale of Mirataz. Substantially all of the $878,000 in product revenues for the year 2020 were for Mirataz."

3090,en,1,343,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"As we have noted in prior quarters, the year-over-year increase primarily reflects the inclusion of Kansas facility expenditures in R&D, as it began to manufacture clinical trial material, partially offset by lower payroll and related costs consistent with the decision to discontinue small molecule development in favor of biologics programs."
3091,en,1,261,1,-0.401047,negative,,negative,-0.401047,"Prior to 2020, construction and commissioning expenditures associated with the Kansas facility have been categorized as general and administrative expenses.

For 2020, SG&A expenses were $22 million, compared to $37.9 million in the prior year. The $15.9 million year-over-year decrease is the result of the re-categorization of the Kansas plant expenditures as research and development expenses. And lower payroll and related expenses as a result of the elimination of KindredBio’s companion animal’s sales force."

Good afternoon, maybe two or three from me, but Wendy I’ll start with sort of a guidance, the fully funded guidance until early 2023 is better than the prior. I think the language was mid 2022, the OpEx assumption seemingly did not change clearly you've had several positive announcement over the past few months with parvo, Elanco in contract manufacturing?"

I'm just trying to get the timeframe for the 20 some odd million that you attributed to Vaxart?"

But maybe if you could furnish us with some thoughts on the updates that you from a company perspective, plan to provide along the way, as we think about 2021.

I believe Richard, when you were talking about, IBD, you mentioned, increased conviction that the market size could maybe even be as big as atopic derm. I mean atopic derm, is obviously one of the - the bigger success stories that we've had in the companion animal market. Can you talk to what, led you down that path and mentioned that?

So if you look at the market, so atopic dermatitis is about - affects about 10% of dogs, inflammatory bowel disease, and diseases that are sort of in that similar category affects at least 5% or probably more than 5% of the dog."
3121,en,1,384,1,-0.541785,negative,,negative,-0.73341,"We think the impact on the quality of life is actually more significant for inflammatory bowel disease, because the dog is basically making a mess on the carpet. And there are a lot of parallels to the atopic dermatitis market. Right now, the mainstay is steroids, which is cheap, but has a lot of side effects, including making the dog pee on the carpet, and they become incontinent."
3122,en,1,337,1,0.61804,positive,1,positive,0.584726,"And just like the atopic dermatitis market before the current therapies were launched, the veterinarians and owners had to make do with therapies that were either not effective or has a lot of side effects, the exact same situation in the case in IBD.

And that's different than manufacturing for FDA or EMA."

Maybe just one from me on KIND-030 and but the indication they're being pursued the prophylactic and therapeutic. If the therapeutic pivotal efficacy is successful, when you could elaborate on their regulatory strategy there, is this a label expansion post approval of the prophylactic an amendment to the current submission or completely different filing altogether? Thank you."

3163,en,1,423,1,0.640877,positive,1,positive,0.633923,"Sure. If the treatment study is not positive for some reason, and obviously, there's always some risk whenever you're doing clinical studies. We would launch with the prophylaxis indication or Elanco would. And the advantage of this molecule is that it's the same presentation, its same bio, which means that veterinarians would be free to use the drug for either indication. We would follow that up with a second approval."
3164,en,1,488,1,0.350325,positive,1,positive,0.342318,"Because even if, for some reason one is trouble with the study, we would certainly repeat it because we know the molecule works for treatment. So I would anticipate the sales would still be quite attractive, because veterinarian’s most likely use the drug for both indications obviously, we would not be promoting for an unapproved use. So I think under that scenario, there would be some impact. But the impact would not be - may not be as great as you might otherwise think on revenues."

And Richard maybe just, if you are successful in the therapeutic indication so what is the filing strategy just given that you've initiated the prophylactic filing? Are they two separate filings altogether or how should we think about sort of the timing of therapy, you’re being able to promote therapeutic - indication?"

And manufacturing right now is the rate limiting factor. So even with the delay in the treatment pivotal, we don't anticipate the approval date will be affected. Because the part that we think is going to be the regular limiting factor is the speed at which USDA is able to test the manufacturing samples we send them."
3169,en,1,246,1,-0.479824,negative,1,negative,-0.477857,"So USDA takes the bios from your manufacturing run, and they run their own tests on those samples.

So, the contract that we were awarded the task order has couple of different components. So, it could be under a $1 million to over $1 million for this first portion. So that's why we haven't put out the exact numbers because it's variable to have. They have an option for the second part of the contract."

So in the fourth quarter, the sales to distributors were lower on quarter-over-quarter, but sales from distributors to veterinary clinics increased versus the third quarter.

3209,en,1,20,1,0.992803,positive,,positive,0.992803,Thank you very much.

3211,en,1,443,1,0.823051,positive,,positive,0.859425,"Absolutely. Before we start our fireside chat, we've got a polling question for you. And it's actually quite simple. It's on your screens. And it says, what do you see as the single biggest driver for Deutsche Bank's share price in 2021? And of course, we've got the resilience of IP revenues. We've got the cost efficiencies, NII defense, capital resilience and M&A. We'll come back to the – to that polling question maybe a little bit later."
3212,en,1,427,1,0.526515,positive,1,positive,0.555059,"So Fabrizio, let's start with the investment bank. Of course, the kind of the trends have been strong across the industry. We've heard about it over the last kind of two days. And of course, you yourselves, Christian at the year-end talked about a strong start to the year. So can I just ask how has the kind of quarter continued? And also, kind of how do you see the seasonality of the ID [ph] revenues as the year progresses?"
3213,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Fabrizio Campelli
3214,en,1,638,1,0.870524,positive,,positive,0.851356,"Thank you, Magdalena. Very happy to be here again the second year in a row with you. We did have some of that language in our Q4 results. Christian did speak about good momentum being carried into 2021 from what was a strong 2020. And I have to say six weeks into – later into the year, so towards the end of the first quarter, that momentum has continued quite strongly. And in fact, quarter-to-date, we're seeing revenues being up in the Investment Bank by about 20%. And this is across the franchise, so in Origination  Advisory, as well as in FIC and in particular, in Credit Trading. So a good performance across the Investment Bank."
3215,en,1,18,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Magdalena Stoklosa
3216,en,1,395,1,0.759224,positive,1,positive,0.590232,"Fabrizio, do you want to kind of take it a little bit kind of further for us? Because, of course, the investment kind of banking revenues are kind of also key to your overall group targets. Do you expect the year to be – of course, so far, we've seen it very strongly. I mean, 20%, a very high number. But does – do the comps get – of course, the comps get much harder as we go through the year."
3217,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Fabrizio Campelli
3218,en,1,793,1,0.525044,positive,1,positive,0.558171,"Yes. Of course. I mean we did describe our 2020 performance as one that had some out-performance related to market circumstances. That were not easy to replicate. And yet, we also were very clear in our Investor Day in December that we saw a substantial portion of that out-performance actually being resilient and sustained and sustainable into future years. And I think what we're seeing right now is exactly that strategy playing out. So it's early to tell how the full 2020 will play out, but clearly, we're very encouraged by this start of the year in the business. Also, because we see the performance, like I said, not focused on one particular business only, but distributed across our franchises, and that's true for LDCM, for the DCM franchise, obviously, for ECM, as well as in FIC."
3219,en,1,757,1,0.769391,positive,1,positive,0.824066,"I think it speaks to not just the momentum in the Investment Bank, but the fact that we have our core businesses really having shown great resilience last year and carrying resilience into this year. And it speaks to a certain amount of positive momentum that the bank is experiencing. And we expect that momentum not to abate due to seasonality, but in fact, to continue strongly. So notwithstanding the fact that some of our businesses obviously do experience seasonality, but the indicators we get, the pipelines, the activity, the volumes of inflows in those businesses in which it matters are actually quite positive. So 2021, it's early days, but so far, things are going quite well. And in fact, as I just told you, Investment Bank, better than well."
3220,en,1,18,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Magdalena Stoklosa
3221,en,1,407,1,0.784201,positive,,positive,0.778003,"Perfect. Thank you very much. Very, very encouraging. Now let's kind of look into the transformation of the bank. You've kind of – you've mentioned a little bit offered on the Investment Banking side kind of already. But you're in the job for 15 months. So what are your kind of key takeaways kind of so far? The greatest challenges, particularly last year, and particularly at the backdrop of the pandemic."
3222,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Fabrizio Campelli
3223,en,1,1041,1,-0.259124,negative,1,negative,-0.301143,"Yes. I have been in the job for 15 months. And the job was established to actually support the consequent execution of our strategy. We announced a strategy in July 2019. Shortly thereafter, the Transformation Office was set up. And the purpose was really to give us that systematic focus on executing on a strategy, which was predicated on focusing on businesses in which we wanted to compete to win. The execution clearly has gone to our plan in 2020. And I think it has been the result of a number of ingredients. A lot of effort that has gone into the preparation of the strategy, and the Transformation Office there has contributed to creating the structure around it. I spoke bit about it at the investor detail. We've broken the executional strategy down into 20 initiatives, about 70 key deliverables, 800 milestones. We monitor 130 risk, 130 dependencies between initiatives. It's to create structure and to mitigate the risk of the execution of those long-term strategic building blocks of our execution in any way to go off-track."
3224,en,1,1005,1,0.568777,positive,1,positive,0.545716,"We also built a lot of mechanisms as part of the Transformation Office to stay on track on shorter-term measures, and in a way that would allow us to stay focused on the long-term priorities, but also respond tactically to short-term challenges. Little did we know when we set the office up that way, that COVID would really force us into a lot of these short-term management of difficulty. But things have gone particularly well in 2020 because we have been able to stick to the long-term priorities. As I indicated at the end of the year in our Investor Day, over 90% of our milestones were met, over 130% of the custom – that we were targeting to reduce as part of the key deliverables of the specific transformation initiatives were achieved. And so the program is clearly delivering its goals. And on the short term, more tactical measures, we've also been able to support the bank quite proactively in countering the effects of the crisis, which clearly did have an impact on our ability to execute."
3225,en,1,384,1,0.297697,positive,1,positive,0.327201,"And there were some challenges. Think about, for example, where in the spring, we announced that we had to put a restructuring on hold, not to plunge our employees into what was at that point in time an untenable uncertainty. And when we did that, we had to found countermeasures to stay on track on costs, as we did because we did end up closing the years at a €19.5 billion of cost."
3226,en,1,677,1,0.861274,positive,,positive,0.836014,"I have to say, a very important aspect of this was really creating, and then riding on the positive momentum that was good generated within DB. I think the whole market in 2020 and in 2021 has seen some things that have supported, particularly banks with our business model. But what was specific about Deutsche Bank is that, that momentum we saw from employees, from our clients has really supported us into making these changes. And we see the momentum being stronger now than it was just a year ago. And the measure of that is, when we call our employees, 90% of our staff stands behind the strategy, understands what we're trying to do, and they are actively supporting it."
3227,en,1,542,1,0.851734,positive,,positive,0.804549,"And those are the kind of small things that make a difference. This is the difference between two, three years ago, the effort that was put into these transformation measures, and now seeing our clients starting at seven in the morning, making those phone calls until late at night, supporting us to execute on what we want to do. And an example of that is also in Germany. The standing of the bank, the feedback we get from our retail and commercial banks – sorry, commercial clients in Germany is at a 10-year high on what we are receiving."
3228,en,1,326,1,0.62889,positive,1,positive,0.621411,"And again, showing that – the big effort and the heavy lifting that has happened in the past years is starting to pay off in the results that Deutsche Bank is showing. So my job was also to channel a lot of this energy, keep us organized, come up with new ideas. And we intend to carry that momentum firmly into 2021 and 2022."
3229,en,1,18,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Magdalena Stoklosa
3230,en,1,432,1,0.597128,positive,1,positive,0.59309,"Perfect. At the investment, kind of deep dive in December, you've also announced a partnership with Google. And could you just elaborate what are the benefits of it? And how should we think about it from the perspective of financial impact? Is it a net positive kind of on the revenue side? Is it net negative on the cost short term because of the, I suppose, upfront Investment? Could you give us a sense of what's happening there?"
3231,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Fabrizio Campelli
3232,en,1,686,1,0.902711,positive,,positive,0.880757,"Sure. The Google partnership we signed, which made us the primary financial partner to Google and is actually designed to actually play right into the spirit of the transformation I outlined. Transformation, we always – we often think about it being a cost play, when in reality for DB, it's a revenue growth play, a cost play, a culture play. And on the cost side, I mentioned a few examples. But on the revenue side as well, we are really aiming to build momentum around our growth, particularly by harvesting more of this cross-divisional capability, which are, in turn, built on deepening and leveraging better our client relationships, and the Google partnership plays right there."
3233,en,1,617,1,0.833695,positive,,positive,0.838897,"So we have signed this partnership with the three fundamental objectives in mind. The first one is to really change the way we develop technology going forward at Deutsche Bank. And the spirit there, Bernd has been quite open about it in his speech in – at investor event in December. The spirit there is to change the way we develop our applications and using better technology that Google can make available to us in the way we architect, develop and use technological infrastructure to get to a more flexible, better architect and more scalable, safer set of technology and application solutions to clients faster."
3234,en,1,550,1,0.888805,positive,,positive,0.885624,"The second part is innovation. Because, thanks to a joint recruiting of engineers, the co-creation of solutions, we will be able to develop applications and make them available to clients in ways that were not possible before to us alone. And the third part actually is a cost effectiveness play because we are effectively moving to a much more variable cost base. If you think about it, we move from a world in which we would buy and use our infrastructure to actually having, thanks to the hyperscale model, a model in which we pay for what we use."
3235,en,1,629,1,0.867472,positive,,positive,0.856179,"And all of this will actually contribute to making us more innovative, better client responsive, and obviously, enhance growth, and come up with new products and new ideas that will make revenue solutions to our clients and reaching new clients possible, and over time, also achieve a higher level of cost efficiency. We're talking about a 10.5 year partnership we have signed. So the time horizon for many of these benefits will distribute over that period of time. And they play right into the spirit of making the strategy of Deutsche Bank a long-term one and making us sustainably profitable and competitive in the long-term."
3236,en,1,18,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Magdalena Stoklosa
3237,en,1,457,1,0.956618,positive,,positive,0.967021,"Brilliant. Because that actually leads me to a couple of cost questions. And I think before I go into those cost questions, I think you'll be – you'll be pleased to know that our poll has closed and the highest answer to the share price question, almost 40% is still continuing cost delivery. So no pressure on the cost questions. So of course, you've lowered your 2022 cost target. And what do you see as the contribution of the Transformation Office here?"
3238,en,1,17,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Fabrizio Campelli
3239,en,1,384,1,0.832906,positive,,positive,0.851893,"Well, we did see very strong momentum on costs. And we have often spoken about the 12th consecutive quarter of adjusted cost reductions. And again, that shows a very thoughtful execution of how we intend to go about the delivery of the efficiency, which is one of the core tenets of the Compete To Win strategy we have announced. And we intend to keep driving that into 2021 and 2022."
3240,en,1,708,1,0.940672,positive,,positive,0.84502,"I think the further reduction of our target, from €17 billion to €16.7 billion in 2022, and – obviously reflects the fact that as a team, we continue to see opportunities to harvest on investment made to date, investments we are continuing to make in 2021. And obviously, we are contributing with some of those ideas. And I described some of them. If you think about how the Transformation Office is playing into this, we look at adding and catalyzing new ideas, building on the cost catalyst initiative that James von Moltke started a few years ago and continuing to drive new thoughts. And some of these are relatively small, like a more consistent use of tools and workflow tools to optimize our expenses."
3241,en,1,735,1,0.787787,positive,,positive,0.768806,"For example, when it comes to our vendor professional service expenses, some are medium-sized and larger size. We have been speaking about end-to-end process re-engineering as a mechanism by which we can €60 million of incremental cost in 2022 by using artificial intelligence technology partners that enable us to much faster engineering of end-to-end processes. And some are more fundamental, more transformative, like – as the shift of attention is focusing from cost reduction in the businesses to infrastructure, as much of the heavy lifting in the business has already occurred, a much higher focus on end-to-end process realignment and the re-architecting from front-to-back perspective becomes a big enabler of further savings."

We've got €2 billion cost cuts in 2022. Now can you kind of talk to us about your level of confidence that, that 2022 cost target, that €16.7 billion, is – I mean how difficult is it to achieve?

And between end of 2000 – to end of 2022 is now only €2.8 billion left.

But thanks to the investment we're making this year, it would also carry momentum into 2023 and beyond. So overall, I would say, we have a strong conviction, obviously, into our 2022 targets.

As we normalize the transformation cycle, we moved back to being a bank that can deliver and will deliver 8% return on tangible equity, which is what our target is as we move back to having the heavy portion of the therapy behind us, it will also be important to move back to a more relative measurement of cost efficiency."

The vast majority will be operational risk-weighted assets, which we'll pay down over time, approximately €9 million related to credit and market risk. And those are going to have a stickier profile.

So for example, for Q1, we expect our credit loss provisions to come in at properly around half of the current consensus of €360 million.

We are seeing a great momentum in that part of the business ourselves. And it is a kind of product we're looking at because we obviously want to build on long-term momentum.

I think we gained across Investment Banking over – almost 0.5 percentage points of market share. And we see that momentum having continued actually in 2021.

What we are seeing – and 2020 was a good display of that, and 2021 is actually very positive in confirming that, is that, that strategy of refocusing our franchise away from equities and much more into the origination advisory capital markets pieces and within FIC, on our financing, trading and the macro businesses, is actually paying out, because those are businesses in which DB has gained market share, has strengthened its position in ways that actually play right in the hand of the rest of the bank and in the rest of the franchise where we can truly become more client-centric and operate in businesses, in Investment Bank in which we can continue to support our, for example, corporate client base into 2021 and beyond."

We've talked about it a lot. Of course, 2022, and it's expectations for kind of 2021. As you look at your kind of revenue diversification going forward, so kind of medium term, do you think that there is a situation where the other parts of the group are likely to increase their revenue mix? So a lot of moving parts, but kind of – but longer term, how do you see the revenue mix?"

3316,en,1,731,1,0.640413,positive,1,positive,0.688263,"Well, our strategy has not changed to what we had announced in 2019. In fact, what is happening right now, it's clearly been more beneficial to the Investment Bank and the environment; particularly the adverse interest rates have really made it harder for the rest of our core bank businesses to perform to the level that is their potential. But based on everything we're doing and the things I was describing to you earlier, actually, there is a lot of untapped momentum, untapped potential in those businesses, which in a normalized interest rates environment, as we really think about that reflation wave that may come across will really benefit precisely those businesses that we see as the remaining part of our core strategy."
3317,en,1,380,1,0.848498,positive,,positive,0.905142,"So as you look into 2022, 2023 and beyond, the strategy we laid out, to want to compete to win on four businesses, obviously, the Investment Bank, but also the Corporate Bank, a well-rounded Private Bank, which sits on our pillar in Germany and a pillar internationally, and our Asset Management franchise with BWS, we believe that all of them will actually behave quite strongly."
3318,en,1,620,1,0.771631,positive,1,positive,0.768405,"The best thing we're doing right now is to ensure that, relative to competition, those businesses perform well. And already in 2020, in a year in which everybody, in our continent in particular, suffered quite markedly from the macroeconomic environment around us, our franchises in Corporate Bank and in the Retail Bank actually performed quite strongly. So we expect all of that to then pay off all the effort and the confidence that we have, as a management team, our people, our clients, to help us navigate exactly the strategy we laid out. So that we can make Deutsche Bank sustainably profitable in the long term."

On the call with us today are Ryan Greenawalt, our Chairman and CEO; and Tony Colucci, our Chief Financial Officer. For today's call management will first provide a review of the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. And then we will conduct a Q&A session. We will begin with some prepared remarks before we open the call for your question."

3347,en,1,470,1,0.948401,positive,,positive,0.946994,"Thank you, Sinem and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining Alta Equipment Group's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Our strong performance and solid financial results in the fourth quarter capped off a transformative and very successful 2020 despite the significant impact of the COVID pandemic. We achieved several important accomplishments which I'll briefly touch on before turning the call over to Tony for a financial review of the fourth quarter and full year."
3348,en,1,888,1,0.665265,positive,1,positive,0.658769,"The operating environment for our services continued to improve from the prior quarter as customer demand increased consecutively each month in the fourth quarter. Labor productivity, which is the heartbeat of our operations increased to benchmark levels before the end of the year. In response to increased sales activity and demand for labor hours, we added to our product support workforce both, organically and through acquisitions and ended the year with over 900 skilled technicians, an increase of approximately 250 technicians year-over-year, and representing roughly half of our total headcount. Our entire Alta team once again rose to the occasion during these difficult times demonstrating incredible dedication and delivered on our commitment to exceptional service and equipment uptime. A sincere thank you to all of our employees who make Alta the great company it is today."
3349,en,1,1088,1,0.718883,positive,1,positive,0.708113,"And touching on our financial highlights; fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $24.6 million on revenue of $280.4 million. We reached a true milestone in delivering over $1 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis with adjusted pro forma EBITDA of $98.7 million for the year. Our liquidity position remains strong and our balance sheet flexible in providing the support needed to execute our organic and acquisition growth strategy. And looking at the full year, we overcame many challenges that we faced due to the COVID pandemic and navigated the business through unprecedented shutdowns. We were designated as an essential business and remain fully operational at all of our 54 branches across 11 states. Our variable cost structure and the dexterity of our business model allows management to swiftly implement cost reduction measures to efficiently manage the business and sustain positive adjusted EBITDA and mitigate against margin declines. The revenue decline was less than anticipated and business activity began to pick up from the April trough through the end of the year."
3350,en,1,1385,1,0.745767,positive,1,positive,0.755464,"As we move through the recovery in the second half of the year, we reduced some of the cost mitigation measures and began calling back skilled technicians who were furloughed as big business activity returned to pre-COVID levels. The diversity of both, our geographies and our end-markets enabled us to weather the pandemic storm. Also as a reflection of our business model, our product support revenue remained strong during this period and grew 47% in 2020, compared to the prior year when including our required revenues. In 2020 consistent with our acquisition strategy, we expanded our geographic footprint, established relationships with new OEM partners, and further diversified our end-market reach. In the fourth quarter, we completed two accretive acquisitions that increased our scale and strengthened our business profile. We acquired the construction dealership assets of Vantage Equipment which operates three branches in the northern region of New York State. Alta is now the authorized distributor of Volvo products in most of New York State, a region that offers significant additional expansion opportunities. Vantage also diversifies our customer base and serves as a great complement to our Lifttech business which serves the New York material handling market. This combination is powerful and allows us to bring our full resources to this large and growing market."
3351,en,1,403,1,0.63896,positive,,positive,0.75071,"As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we closed the Howell Tractor and Equipment acquisitions in late October. Howell serves the Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana construction markets with a wide range of construction and crane equipment. Howell enjoys a strong relationship with leading manufacturers such as Sennebogen, which is a new addition to Alta's product line in the region."
3352,en,1,535,1,0.865313,positive,,positive,0.866967,"Looking at the full year, we completed seven acquisitions which in total contributed approximately $23 million to adjusted EBITDA in 2020, our most active year on the M&A front. Alta has become the partner of choice in the fragmented equipment dealer market as we provide manufacturers the benefit of our scale, liquidity and reputation to facilitate share growth and customer loyalty. The structural supply demand and balance between buyers and sellers in our industry remains intact and we continue to execute on our growth strategy."
3353,en,1,1007,1,0.888421,positive,,positive,0.881727,"As we noted in today's news release, we've rebranded our Industrial Segments and Material Handling. Material Handling is the recognized industry vernacular and better describes the range of our capabilities. The rebranding will have particular significance of messaging to the e-commerce sector which values the integration of Material Handling equipment with the more sophisticated systems offerings. PeakLogix, a national material handling systems integrator we acquired in mid-year has significantly enhanced our positioning in this area and provides us with a competitive advantage in the fast growing, warehousing and logistics market, which has only continued to pick up steam as the recovery continuous. Peak offers a complete material management solution and delivers efficiency and increased productivity for it's customers. We've been able to cross-sell and promote their services across our entire material handling customer base, and integrate them with our other warehouse automation solutions."
3354,en,1,388,1,0.810603,positive,,positive,0.857648,"We also expanded our full service capabilities in this area, more recently with a small but strategic acquisition in ScottTech, which provides warehouse control software and systems. It is important to highlight that these new systems integration services are unconstrained by our dealership territories and both acquired businesses have customers throughout the U.S. and internationally."
3355,en,1,1091,1,0.87086,positive,,positive,0.857181,"And looking forward we see a clear path to a full recovery as the recovery takes hold and the year progresses. The investments we've made in technology products and people position us well to continue our strong performance entering 2021. We're encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing, especially by the strong secular tailwinds that are apparent in our material handling and construction segments. E-commerce growth is driving higher volumes from large retailers who warehouse their products which increases our opportunity to expand and lean into this area of the business. The demand for automation and more complex systems and technology in warehousing and material handling has never been greater, and we believe it is in the early stages. There is clearly upside from potential federal stimulus and pent-up demand for capital projects to improve our net -- our aging national infrastructure. Alta's strong relationships with leading OEMs and our recent geographic market expansion position us to be a great partner for both, material handling and construction equipment markets."
3356,en,1,611,1,0.987635,positive,,positive,0.986939,"This was truly a transformative year by any measure; we believe our strong financial results in our first year as a public company demonstrate the outstanding execution of our resilient dealership model and our operational discipline through a difficult and unprecedented time. We are exciting -- excited and increasingly confident in our ability to deliver increased financial results and enhanced shareholder value moving forward. I'd like to thank our manufacturing partners for their support, our dedicated employees for their hard work, and our shareholders for their support and confidence in the company."

3359,en,1,156,1,0.997879,positive,,positive,0.984734,"Thank you, Ryan and good evening, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Alta Equipment Group and our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results."
3360,en,1,780,1,0.791045,positive,,positive,0.888678,"Before I start, I first want to congratulate all of my Alta colleagues, and all of Alta's shareholders on our one year anniversary as a public company. The past year has been equal parts challenging and exciting. Navigating a global pandemic certainly wasn't part of our plan as we entered the public markets 13 months ago, but our business and most importantly, Alta's employees rose to COVID's challenge and delivered a performance that Ryan and I are extremely grateful for, and proud of. Additionally, I want to welcome our new team members at Vantage Equipment, and ScottTech in upstate New York to the Alta family. The senior leadership team is excited about integrating your talents into our business and into Alta's one team culture. We look forward to earning your trust."
3361,en,1,1273,1,0.82207,positive,,positive,0.804924,"My remarks today will focus on four key areas: first, I'll be presenting our fourth quarter performance, which we are pleased with. As the business continues to close in the COVID gap and gain ground year-over-year on some key metrics. I'll be focusing in on specific departmental revenue figures, organic cash flows and rental fleet fluctuations, and outperformance on these metrics impacted the balance sheet and our leverage profile in a positive way. Second, I'll be discussing our full year 2020 performance and sequential quarter-over-quarter trends in two of our key performance indicators. Specifically, I'll discuss how those KPI trends correlated to EBITDA performance for the year, and how those 2020 trends compared to 2019, a year reflective of a more typical business climate. Third, I want to touch on year-end acquisition of Vantage Equipment, how we thought about the return profile of our investment when compared to the cost of capital associated with the preferred stock we raised to fund the transaction. I also want to provide some high level financial figures on the ScottTech acquisition that we closed at the beginning of this month. Lastly, I'll discuss the balance sheet, and in particular, our leverage and liquidity position as we entered 2021."
3362,en,1,382,1,0.719786,positive,,positive,0.69875,"Real quickly, it should be noted that there are some slides in our presentation which was released prior to our call today that presents our fourth quarter and full year numbers in greater detail than what I will discuss today. I'd encourage everyone on today's call to review our presentation, and our 10-K which is available on our Investor Relations website at altaequipment.com."
3363,en,1,835,1,0.646132,positive,1,positive,0.579171,"With the first portion of my prepared remarks; fourth quarter performance. First, let's talk about the profit and loss statement. For the quarter, the company recorded revenue of $280 million, which is a record sales number for Alta. I'll get into what drove that figure to such a high level in a moment but the $280 million represents a $60 million sequential increase over Q3 and a 9.4% increase on an organic basis versus Q4 2019. From an EBITDA perspective, we realized $24.6 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, up from $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2020. Importantly, our adjusted pro forma EBITDA for Q4, which assumes we had owned Vantage and Howell for the entire quarter was $26.2 million, or $2.7 million less than Q4 of 2019. I'll come back to that $2.7 million EBITDA variance a little later in my comments."
3364,en,1,741,1,0.720125,positive,,positive,0.751337,"Next, I'd like to talk about organic cash flows in the fourth quarter. First, I mentioned the $280 million in revenue a moment ago, and how that was a record sales number for the business. Just to focus in on that briefly; on previous calls I mentioned how the fourth quarter is typically the largest equipment sales quarter of the year for Alta, and in particular, it's historically been our largest rental equipment sales quarter of the year. Really in a bit further, new and used equipment sales were $135 million for the quarter, a $37 million increase over Q3; another record number. But importantly, we recorded an additional $38 million of rental equipment sales for the quarter, a number that is two times the amount sold in Q3 2020."
3365,en,1,622,1,0.805078,positive,,positive,0.860335,"The reason why I focused on the $38 million rental disposal number is because it led to a net decrease of $10.5 million in rental fleet, which when coupled with our EBITDA for the quarter led to an organic delivering of approximately $15 million, and an unlevered free cash flow conversion on EBITDA factor of over 100% for Q4 2020. We believe this organic delevering to be a powerful indication on the marketability of our rental fleet assets and our ability to generate cash flow and liquidity by optimizing our rental fleet in a short period of time. On an organic basis, we believe this to be the story of the quarter."
3366,en,1,648,1,0.910268,positive,,positive,0.908398,"Few other P&L highlights before I move on. And just to jump back to the equipment sales number in Q4 just for a second; let's keep in mind our razor and blade business model. The $103 million in equipment sales for the quarter is now customer field population which bodes well for the future of our high margin product support departments. Another encouraging metric from the P&L; we saw a $2.5 million rental revenue increase over Q3 2020 on an organic basis, an indication of continued strengthening in our rental business. And importantly, continued year-over-year organic growth in our parts and service departments in our construction segment."
3367,en,1,665,1,0.733108,positive,,positive,0.659295,"Moving on to the second key area of my prepared remarks. I'd like to focus on some high level pro forma numbers for the full year 2020 and certain quarter-over-quarter trends in key performance indicators we observed throughout the year. First, for the fiscal year 2020, as Ryan mentioned, on a pro forma basis our annual revenue is now slightly above the $1 billion mark. And on an adjusted pro forma basis, our EBITDA as of the year -- as of year-end was nearly $100 million. A few key points and trends to point out is we do a look back on 2020, and I'd like to refer everyone to Slide 19 of our earnings presentation which depicts the data I'll be referring to."
3368,en,1,573,1,0.832493,positive,,positive,0.841896,"First, as we've discussed on previous calls, two major drivers of EBITDA cash flows in our business correlate to two key performance indicators we track; labor productivity and rental fleet utilization. Of note and discussed on prior calls, we saw the bottom in labor productivity in Q2 2020 began to recover on the metric in Q3, and I'm happy to report that we were able to achieve pre-COVID labor productivity levels in Q4; that trend has continued as we moved into Q1. So for labor productivity, a V-shaped recovery to be sure, and with positive trends headed into 2021."
3369,en,1,688,1,0.704787,positive,1,positive,0.485197,"Second, rental utilization which I -- which as I have mentioned previously, has lagged historic levels realized in our business. And as you will note on slide 19, our physical utilization variants versus the prior years followed a similar trend that labor productivity followed in 2020. We began to see the follow-up towards the end of Q1, the year-on-year variance was most acute in Q2, we started recovering in Q3, and continued to close the gap in Q4. Now, unlike labor productivity, as of the end of the year, we have yet to fully close the gap on rental utilization. Having said that, and importantly, the early signs in Q1 are encouraging and suggest a continued closing of the gap."
3370,en,1,673,1,0.61064,positive,,positive,0.678795,"So, in summary, as we looked at these two key KPIs and how they trended throughout 2020, and we correlate them against our EBITDA performance throughout the year; we noticed similar trend in terms of the gap versus historic norms. Again, referring to slide 19 you will note that our year-on-year EBITDA performance mimics the trends observed in the two KPIs. In summary, of the $13.7 million in EBITDA variance for the year, approximately 75% was incurred in Q2 and Q3. Importantly, as with both the KPIs, we continue to narrow the year-on-year EBITDA gap here in Q4 with the gap being $2.7 million on a pro forma basis for the quarter versus a $6.7 million gap in Q3 2020."
3371,en,1,474,1,0.297983,positive,1,negative,-0.327618,"Last item of note in this section of my commentary, the turbulence of 2020 disguised a typical seasonality in our business, and in particular, the seasonality of our EBITDA. In the EBITDA look-back chart on slide 19, you will note that almost 25% of our pro forma 2020 EBITDA more typically and expectedly given our construction [Technical Difficulty] annual EBITDA, Q2 and Q4 delivered 20% and 25% each, and [Technical Difficulty] the macro backdrop [Technical Difficulty]."
3372,en,1,721,1,0.865442,positive,,positive,0.842215,"For the third area of my prepared remarks; I'd like to briefly touch on our recent M&A activity in the preferred stock offering we contemplated [Technical Difficulty]. For the year, we completed our acquisition of Vantage at an additional $40 million of revenue. The acquisition further expands our territorial reach with Volvo and provides for natural synergies with Lifttech, our material handling operation in upstate New York. At a total enterprise value of about $23 million, we believe the deal to be accretive from an EBITDA multiple standpoint, as well as in comparison to the cost of capital we sourced to fund the transaction, which was the preferred stock offering we completed in concert with the acquisition."
3373,en,1,361,1,0.952434,positive,,positive,0.952434,"With approximately 30 technicians serving a market territory known to be greater in size in our established Michigan territory, where we staff more than 100 technicians, we see -- we see a tremendous aftermarket opportunity and expect to double the size of that business overtime, thereby furthering the accretion over the cost of capital used to fund the deal."
3374,en,1,576,1,0.835217,positive,,positive,0.766532,"Onto ScottTech; on March 1, we completed the acquisition of ScottTech Integrated Solution as a complement to our PeakLogix acquisition completed in the middle of 2020. Specializing a warehouse management software and systems integration, we believe the combination of PeakLogix and ScottTech further expands our full solution product offerings and increases our commitment to the emerging technology space. At a purchase price of approximately $2.5 million, the acquisition adds approximately $10 million of revenue in close to a $1 million of annual EBITDA to the enterprise."
3375,en,1,681,1,0.840014,positive,,positive,0.929242,"For the last part of my prepared remarks, I want to give a quick update on the balance sheet and our credit profile at the end of Q4. Two key factors here to discuss: leverage and liquidity. First, leverage. I mentioned early in the call, we realized an organic de-leveraging in the business by virtue of our big quarter in rental equipment sales. That factor alongside solid EBITDA performance in the quarter and the use of the preferred stock offering to fund advantage acquisition all led to total leverage reducing from about 3.6x EBITDA in Q3 to 3.4x at year end, which with senior leverage dropping to 1.8x, with both leverage ratios being well inside our leverage covenants."
3376,en,1,874,1,0.769697,positive,1,positive,0.803769,"Touching on liquidity. And we feel really good about our position here. Recall that we closed the IPO with roughly $150 million in cash and revolving liquidity. Since the IPO in mid-February, we've acquired five, and now at six strategic business funding growth CapEx in our rental fleets, specifically in an emerging market like Florida, in service the cash cost of our debt. As of the end of Q4, I'm happy to report, the business held the same level of liquidity that it had at the IPO or approximately $150 million. We believe holding liquidity at these levels, given all the challenges and activity that 2020 presented to be an impressive result, a reflection of our cash flow profile and a strong collateral base, which we use to fund important strategic investments. This is also a testament to how we thoughtfully positioned our capital structure and how we fund M&A."
3377,en,1,424,1,0.975423,positive,,positive,0.952988,"In closing, I want to thank all of my teammates at Alta for your commitment to the business and to each other throughout 2020. To our investors, we appreciate the opportunity to be stewards of your capital, and appreciate your support as we navigated our first year as a public company. I have great faith in our proven business model, our leadership team and our vision for the future and look forward to a successful 2021."

3389,en,1,158,1,0.577366,positive,,neutral,0.0,A couple of quick questions. Your adjusted EBITDA margins today are around 10%. Can you talk about some of the drivers to margin expansion in 2021 and beyond?
3390,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Tony Colucci
3391,en,1,1266,1,0.513361,positive,1,positive,0.595751,"Sure, Alex. When we look back at the fourth quarter there, I've made special note in my comments about the large amount of rental equipment sales. And so for the quarter, it's going to feel like, it's going to look like that our EBITDA margins were depressed, but it really was a function of all of the equipment sales and to refer back to the razor and the blades concept that's inherent in our business model. As you know, razors don't have as good of margin as the blades and so that that mix got thrown out of whack there in the fourth quarter. As we drive forward here, obviously the business model is to continue to grow, feel the [ph] population, build the product support business, which is higher margin in the future. So we would think that the mix, as we continue to move along, won't be the same as it was in the fourth quarter and shift more kind of appropriately back toward a more regular mix of parts and service, thereby kind of driving that EBITDA margin a little bit further north in the future. When we think about rental, EBITDA margins on rental are very high as well. We had some positive news there and it continue to trend in the appropriate direction. So, so long as rental continues to trend, that will also drive the EBITDA margin higher."

3399,en,1,1350,1,0.788017,positive,,positive,0.779755,"Sure. We think about the first leg being territorial expansion with our two most significant OEM partners. And those opportunities, we're always watching for, but there has to be a catalyst, some kind of succession planning issue or a catalyst, a reason for one of the ownership groups to be looking for an exit. What we have a lot of, is infill opportunities, which there were several examples of that last year. As we as we look to some of these markets where we're less mature or the new entrants and taking over territories where we can grow share, we'll be looking to build the product portfolio and there could certainly be an M&A component of that talking in smaller dealerships in our existing footprint. And in terms of the third segment, as we mentioned on the last call, we're very focused on kind of watching the evolution of transportation, the electrification of the over the road fleet. Over the road, the truck segment is something that we'd like to be in long term. And as the business evolves, we think that we're really well-positioned with our experience in both electric, on the battery side and the fuel cell side from our material handling business. So those are conversations that we're open to. It's sort of very active time. A lot of new companies coming to market and that we do envision something long term in that sector."

3411,en,1,734,1,0.68676,positive,,positive,0.671612,"Oh, yes, by in large Mike, it was the equipment sales as I mentioned. Rental equipment sales. As customers, we get toward year end, customers have capital budgets that maybe they're looking to get rid of for the year, if you will. We also have customers that have historically looked to take advantage of bonus depreciation from a tax perspective. And so, the fourth quarter is usually overweight equipment sales and it was again this year, probably more than we expected. But that equipment sales number is what's driving a lot of the organic growth. We did have organic growth, as we mentioned in the rental line in parts and service and construction as well. Which all kind of bodes well when you kind of peel the layers back here."

I'll have little [ph] spent some time during the downturn, kind of pairing assets, making sure they had [ph] -- it was the best performers and the best outlook. Did you allow that during Q2 to Q4? And of course you have a better performance ahead for the rental fleet from a margin perspective in 2021?"

3415,en,1,1387,1,0.647366,positive,1,positive,0.586378,"Yes, Mike, this is Tony. I'll take that one. So, when we think about rental, we're thinking always about utilization and cash flows off of it. Not necessarily gross margin, because there's so much depreciation in there. But as we move through Q2 and Q3, we had already kind of committed to making some investments down in Florida, with the Flagler acquisition and adding rental fleet down there. We think long term that it's still the right thing to do. And what we did here in the fourth quarter was kind of optimize a little bit. I mentioned the reduction of about $10 million in organic kind of acquisition costs here. As we left the year end as you'll see, in our numbers, we got roughly a $400 million fleet headed into 2021. We feel good about that fleet level. It may ebb and flow. If we have a $400 million fleet, you'll see in our numbers we turned over almost a quarter of that fleet in the year, which is part of our business model is that rent-to-sell [ph] with the heavy equipment to get it out in the field population. So at any rate, the fleet may ebb and flow a little bit, but by in large, the expectation here is that we're going to keep the fleet kind of in that same level, let the market kind of decide demand to see if we're going to expand, or if we have to pair back some more. But we don't at this point have expectation of growing the fleet in any material way."

The EBITDA that we saw in Q4 and the exit rate for the year, is that a good sort of baseline minimum for the full year, adding in perhaps maybe $9 million to $10 million for the last two deals a bit in the fourth quarter? And from there, do you have any sense as to what you might get from close [ph] perspective in 2021?"

The number that I would refer you to in the fourth quarter as kind of a good metric to maybe build off as we move along here is the $26.2 million of pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter. I made special mention of kind of the seasonality here as we as we go along and how that seasonality kind of gets flipped around a little bit in 2020. But, I think that fourth quarter numbers are a good one to build off of. Relative to organic growth we have the coming off of 2020, we would we would expect some. We're impacted by COVID, so we certainly think we'll be jumping off of 2020 levels. How much? It kind of remains to be seen and I'm not sure we're prepared to give a number at this point."

The one metric that I think we could -- we don't have the number top of mind in terms of how many organic hires we add, if you will, throughout the year. And it gets a little foggy with given COVID and the furloughs and so on and so forth. The one metric that we are kind of pointing to is we've talked a lot about the aftermarket opportunity we saw down at Flagler in Florida. When we took that dealership over, they had 63 technicians. I think we closed the year with 83 technicians on staff down there. So growing in all the right areas where there's a lot of opportunity. Now that same 50% increase or whatever the number is there -- 30% maybe -- we would not have realized that in other areas. It would have been more muted than that.

I like to say by the end of Q1, we would see that utilization gap close. I think the comment that I would make is if we continue to see trends of what we see here in Q1, that utilization gap will get closed here, hopefully by the middle of the year, or in Q2 at some point.

3457,en,1,801,1,0.546717,positive,1,positive,0.577105,"Yes. I think the way that I would answer that, Matt, is if had $100 of rental fleet, kind of on the hand acquisition costs, in a more normal situation, we might have $60 or $65 of that out on rent. The variance that we saw and the shocks that we saw was something like take 10% off of that figure. So the $60 becomes $54, if you will, and then you can kind of extrapolate that into our business. You can kind of see what happens to EBITDA so on and so forth thereafter. But again, rough math that's kind of what we saw. And it was in the pockets of the fleet. Our material handling fleet didn't see as big of a shock that our construction fleet did in Q2 and Q3. So the 10% figures that I gave you is kind of the mix and the most acute that we saw when you kind of fully mix the entire fleet together."

And then can you also comment from an M&A perspective, I would imagine the assets that are serving the material handling side of warehousing, logistics, ecommerce, they were starting to see some multiple inflation there. So are those transactions -- do you have anything sort of in the pipeline serving that market? Or is that something that you're happy with the asset base to have in the organic opportunity in front of you that maybe you're not looking at organically now there? Thank you."

We would be opportunistic if we saw something, but we think that we have the platform that we need. This is a business that we acquired intellectual property and now you could think of it as we've taken a group that had half a dozen salespeople on the stream today.

Mutations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, which occur in an estimated 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, are associated with aggressive disease. Numerous recent reports of clinical data have demonstrated that activation of this pathway, either through the loss of KEAP1 function or activation of NRF2, are associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving frontline standard of care therapies, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy."

3606,en,1,178,1,0.972116,positive,,positive,0.856744,"But before we go to the fireside chat and Q&A, I think Ed and Lori are going to walk through a bit of a presentation. So with that, guys, thanks for joining us. And take it away."

3608,en,1,452,1,0.819131,positive,,positive,0.829839,"Great. Thanks, Steve and Jeff. Appreciate being here. We put out on our Investor Relations website a few charts. And we also put an 8-K out with the charts on it, if anyone wants to take a look at those. But let me just summarize a couple of the few of the key points that are on there. Number one, we're reconfirming guidance for the first quarter and for the full year on net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. So feeling very good about that."
3609,en,1,627,1,0.912147,positive,,positive,0.906499,"Secondly, I would like to just highlight for a moment the Laird acquisition that we announced a week ago for $2.3 billion. Number one, strategically, we feel very good about the fit of this business with our E&I segment. This business really brings 2 key technologies for us. They have a lot of solutions around managing heat and product -- protect devices from electromagnetic interference. And these are 2 very key items that need to be addressed over time with the miniaturization and more computing power that's occurring in the industry that, we think, is a great secular a growth area for us for many, many years to come."
3610,en,1,405,1,0.951925,positive,,positive,0.954416,"And it really touches on a lot of capabilities across the board here, whether it's 5G, smart autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, AI and high-performance computing, think of things like gaming consoles and things like that. So really a nice fit. And really, it will give us a solution sale to our OEM and customers in the marketplace, really a complete package. So we're really excited about that."
3611,en,1,498,1,0.928774,positive,,positive,0.927185,"We're highly confident in the synergies we can get from this field. We've announced cost synergies of $60 million. It's going to cost us $40 million to actually get those synergies, but we will have -- achieve a high single-digit ROIC on this by year 5. So very confident in the financials of it. And we basically paid 11x for the business with the cost synergies accounted in there. So again, we feel very good financially and I think a good investment for us, and therefore, for our shareholders."
3612,en,1,493,1,0.842499,positive,,positive,0.852957,"And then let me just close with our capital allocation. As you all know, we had about $5 billion of excess cash going into this year and through this year. A lot of that came from the proceeds we got from the N&B and IFF transaction. And so we will delever the balance sheet here. We got one more payment to make in May with an outstanding bond. And we will have our ratings -- or metrics right where we wanted, 2.75, which is a very strong BBB rating. So balance sheet will be in great shape."
3613,en,1,478,1,0.616022,positive,1,positive,0.624926,"We announced last week, in addition to our already outstanding share repurchase, which is $1 billion, and then we just announced $1.5 billion on top of that, that will run for about the next year and a few months. So about $2.5 billion of share repurchase firepower here in the near term. And then, of course, with the $2.3 billion we paid for the Laird acquisition. You can see that about takes care of a lot of the cash very quickly that's excess sitting on our balance sheet."
3614,en,1,343,1,0.344875,positive,,positive,0.669343,"We are looking at -- as I've highlighted on the last earnings call, we're looking at one other tuck-in acquisition. Don't know if it will happen or not. But it's in the $200 million to $300 million range. So that could potentially happen. If that is going to happen, it would be over the next quarter that we would know that and announce that."
3615,en,1,917,1,0.743875,positive,,positive,0.725688,"Again, as we also announced on the last quarterly earnings. We're maintaining our current dividend of $1.20 per share, and we plan on talking to the Board in raising that consistently year in and year out. And we also, on our kind of allocation of capital, are keeping our CapEx at around 5%. We would like to work that down in a couple of years in the range of 4% to 5%, but we have a couple of years here of a couple of big expansion products capped on in our electronics business and our new Line 8 on Tyvek. So that will be in that kind of low-5 range for a couple of years, and then we'll work that down more as we move forward. And R&D will continue to run at 4%. Remember, that's very varied by business, the highest spend, obviously, in the E&I business, the lower spend in the M&M business. Just so I think feel very good about how we're balancing our capital allocation decisions here as we go through 2021."
3616,en,1,84,1,0.839466,positive,,positive,0.839466,"Steve, with that, I think I'll turn it back over to you, and we can open it for Q&A."

Can you just maybe -- I know you touched on kind of reaffirming the guide, maybe what you're seeing in a couple of the key end markets that I know have been high-level drivers for you guys? Autos, semis, maybe somewhat related these days, perhaps, autos production. Maybe a little bit weaker on supply constraints around semis. What are you seeing out there on kind of the more short-cycle aspects of your business?"
3620,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Edward Breen
3621,en,1,333,1,0.714429,positive,1,positive,0.63297,"Yes. I'll give a few and maybe Lori wants to jump in also. The semi business, obviously, is running very hot. As you know, it's a high-margin business for us also. So that's a nice sign. But clearly, there's supply disruptions out there, force majeures out there. But having said that, our E&I business is having a very nice quarter."
3622,en,1,409,1,-0.655078,negative,,negative,-0.712903,"I think you see the numbers out there. Auto production might be down about 1 million units during this period of time here. But it's not a business that's going to be lost. It's just some shifting of business because of the supply issues that are out there in the marketplace. And clearly, there are shipping logistics issues, especially out on the West Coast. So there's a little bit of disruption with that."
3623,en,1,518,1,-0.56866,negative,1,negative,-0.572436,"But having said that, business is running very hot, and things might just shift out a little bit. I would think by the time we get through the second quarter, a lot of these issues will be resolved. So it's not a market share issue for anybody. It's just maybe delaying some -- but the actual auto business, finished goods inventory is low. Polymer inventory is low in the chain. So it's not like there's any buildup there. I mean the demand is there. And it can't totally be supplied in the time frame people want it."
3624,en,1,494,1,-0.427759,negative,,negative,-0.649987,"But I would just give you maybe another area. The residential business is running very hot, the do-it-yourself stuff on the resi side, really hot. The weaker areas still are commercial construction, oil and gas and aerospace. I would kind of put those in that -- by the way, they are recovering, coming up, but they're not back to kind of 2019 levels. And probably those three markets, oil and gas, commercial construction and aerospace are about 12% of our revenue, somewhere in that ZIP Code."
3625,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Charles Tusa
3626,en,1,105,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,And then how do you see kind of the PP&E-related business moving along here in the next several quarters?
3627,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Edward Breen
3628,en,1,592,1,0.43526,positive,1,positive,0.375535,"Yes. Our forecast is that the PPE stuff for the frontline responders will start to decline, second, third and fourth quarter. But remember, we're sold out on Tyvek. So what we did last year to help with the pandemic is we shifted more of the production to the protective garments. And what we will now do -- we've been shorting the housing market. We were shorting the medical packaging market. By the way, both are nice margin businesses. And so we'll -- if that occurs, where it starts to slow down, we'll start shifting over to those end markets. And the demand is there for us to do that."
3629,en,1,565,1,0.329989,positive,1,positive,0.276336,"So we expect to run Tyvek full out all year. And it's one of the reasons where -- our biggest CapEx program actually is Tyvek Line 8 over in Luxembourg, and that will be online in a couple of years. We've been getting better throughput, as you noticed last year, with Tyvek. So our uptimes or efficiency in our facilities. We've really been putting a lot of work into that, which we're doing across the whole manufacturing platform. And we saw some nice volume increases last year on our production lines, and we're running full capacity, but we got more out of it."

3631,en,1,181,1,-0.379009,negative,,negative,-0.604511,"So I guess, is that on net kind of a flat-to-up scenario for that full product line or modestly down? Or what are we -- how do you think about that whole complex there for the year?"

3633,en,1,345,1,0.526779,positive,,positive,0.645276,Yes. I think you can call it low single digits. And so it obviously runs sold out. There are some multiyear [indiscernible] that will create some noise. But remember that we also brought Line 1 back online. So that's coming up as we speak. That will add incremental capacity to allow us to drive low single-digit-type volume growth within Tyvek.

What -- inflation's coming, how do we kind of gauge price this year? Any changes to your expectations there?"

3641,en,1,285,1,0.651946,positive,,positive,0.623811,"Yes. I would say a couple of areas. The pricing is more important in the M&M business. And sequentially, it's improving from the end of the year through the first quarter, as we said, by about 2 percentage points. So we'll be down about 2% still because you're not lapping COVID there."
3642,en,1,355,1,0.811917,positive,,positive,0.799394,"And then pricing is very constructive right now in that business. So we feel like any raw material increases, which, by the way, will be somewhat significant this year, we'll be able to cover that with price. And then you'll see more of the price as we go into the second quarter. Obviously, you'll see the ramp occur as we announced some price increases."
3643,en,1,224,1,0.58322,positive,,positive,0.644473,"We expect some price -- ability to get price in what was S&C or W&P now business. So that would be maybe 1% this year, somewhere in that zip code. And that will ramp up more second, third and fourth quarter in that business."
3644,en,1,337,1,0.599542,positive,1,positive,0.443002,"And then the E&I business, Steve, you generally don't get price in that business. It's a volume game. So we've always seen to run about 0% to minus 1% on price, but you're introducing a lot of products quicker cycle. And you get the pricing on the new product when you get some of the feed. So that's kind of how we see the year playing."

3654,en,1,199,1,0.444272,positive,,neutral,0.0,"Ed, I think you signed up for another three year stint in managing DuPont. What do you want to accomplish over those three years? Like when you come to the end, what is it that you want to have done?"

3656,en,1,741,1,0.629671,positive,1,positive,0.706467,"Well, I don't know that three years will be the end. So let me just start out by saying that my -- but I -- yes, I did sign up for three more years with a new contract. Look, a whole bunch of things. I like where we have the portfolio now. It's been a 5-year journey. We've created, I think, 4 incredible companies with the new Dow, with Corteva, DuPont and now N&B merged in IFF, I think we've created a world leader there. So it was a lot of transformation over that 5-year window. Now I really want to -- I don't know if I use the word settle in because that's not my style, but I like where we have DuPont, and I really want to run it well, consistent results, generate good conversion of our cash to be able to reinvest in the business."
3657,en,1,252,1,0.752527,positive,,positive,0.772734,"And I think we're going to have a nice top line growth company, and we have a lot of opportunities on our gross margin line in the company for improvement. And Lori and I are spending a lot of time there with our management team for improvements there."
3658,en,1,142,1,0.818519,positive,,positive,0.818519,"So if I look out three years, I want to be known as one of the premier multi-industrial companies out there, and I want to be valued for that."

3662,en,1,707,1,0.613468,positive,1,positive,0.571198,"Yes. So our gross margins, if you just look back over the last 3, 4 years, were kind of in the mid-30s, 35%. We said we'll make 100 basis point improvement this year on it. There's a few areas for us, but the biggest single area we're focused on now is really on the factory floor. We feel like we have a lot of opportunity for improvement in our supply chain, our forecasting, our uptimes, our reliability metrics. And it's all being driven by data analytic tools, Jeff, that are now available out there. And by the way, these tools are not like ERP systems. They are $200,000, $300,000 digital tools that are doing a lot of data mining and really making it better than the human brain can forecast things."
3663,en,1,633,1,0.881142,positive,,positive,0.876673,"And so we've had some real success with that this past year. So we're implementing a digital upgrade programs throughout the company. We've got a phased by facility where we want to do things. And so that's our single biggest opportunity because, Jeff, as you know, in this business, a couple of points of uptime on some of these heavy assets is a big deal. So like think of the Tyvek line, the Kevlar line, the Nomex lines. It's a big, big deal for us. And a great example of that was the improvements we made in Tyvek last year and got the extra volumes out, and it just drops to the bottom line. So that's our single biggest area."
3664,en,1,470,1,0.785689,positive,,positive,0.798052,"And then we've really oriented our R&D towards these higher secular growth areas, and I think that's going to pay off very well for us over the next 3 to 5 years. They happen to be the higher-growth areas like the Laird acquisition and where we're spending R&D, for instance, in the E&I business and those areas I mentioned a few minutes ago. And they happen to be businesses there for that are going to command higher gross margins, and therefore, higher EBITDA margin."
3665,en,1,407,1,0.63465,positive,1,positive,0.593171,"So we think we've got a 300 to 500 basis point opportunity in the businesses over multiple years. And so a big focus there. And obviously, pricing plays into gross margin expansion. And as we launch these new products in these growth areas, we'll make sure we get the right price for them. So it's a multipronged approach, but the biggest part of it really is factory efficiency piece that we're working on."

That's not the game here. We've got real scale. And because of the breadth of the organization, it's not just the big consumer companies that we can service really well.

One was to resolve the rest of the MDL in Ohio. We did that across DuPont, $27 million. I think the biggest thing, though, on that same announcement was we finally got a deal done. I think we were working on it for about a year, me personally, by the way. And we have a deal now worked out between Corteva, Chemours and us. That's really key to now how we resolve the rest of the issues. Because there's a blueprint, everybody knows their responsibility."

The good news is that's mostly consolidated into an MDL down in South Carolina. And so you can actually wrap your arms around either letting it play out through the court system, which will prove out DuPont has extremely low exposure here when the facts keep coming out, or do we take the path of potentially the 3 companies working together to come up with a settlement agreement."

But I never believe the number would be anywhere near that high. So one of the compromises was we'll put x amount of cash into like a trust fund, and the amount of cash we're putting in is way, way, way less than that number because I don't want dead money sitting around. That's not going to be used. So that's how we structured it."

3804,en,1,482,1,0.90114,positive,,positive,0.896079,"Thank you, Arjun. Good day, everyone. We are excited to welcome you to our first earnings call as a public company. The past several months has been transformational for Desktop Metal. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed the transaction between China and Desktop Metal, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange and began shipping several new products core to our long-term roadmap, ending the year with over $595 million on the balance sheet to fund our growth strategy."
3805,en,1,393,1,0.960213,positive,,positive,0.960392,"I would like to start today by providing an overview of our business for those that are new to our story, about some of the key milestones we achieved in the fourth quarter and discuss some of our strategy going forward. After my remarks, James will cover our evolution to a public company, discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and provide guidance for 2021."
3806,en,1,792,1,0.929319,positive,,positive,0.889803,"First, an overview of our business, starting with our investment highlights on Slide 3. Desktop Metal is the only pure-play additive manufacturing 2.0 company. We are pioneering a new generation of additive manufacturing technologies focused on the production of end-use products to help businesses make high performance products faster, more sustainably in a cost and volume competitive with conventional manufacturing processes. The additive manufacturing market is a significant and growing opportunity that’s expected to go from roughly $12 billion in 2019 to about $146 billion by 2030. This 11x growth is being propelled by a shift from prototyping and tooling into mass production applications and the industry has strong secular tailwind around onshoring and supply chain flexibility."
3807,en,1,753,1,0.820703,positive,,positive,0.781122,"We have a growing portfolio of additive manufacturing 2.0 solutions focused on volume production of end use parts that we think has industry leading price performance and capabilities across the portfolio, with over 190 materials qualified across polymers, metals, ceramics, composites and biocompatible resins. Our products include some of the largest and fastest DLP systems in the market with the Envision One HT and the Xtreme 8K and we have got the fastest metal printer in the market with a Production System P-50. It’s about 100 times faster than product generation technology cycles are part of the future. We have also got a series of developing businesses in composites and biofabrication that we are going to expand as I will discuss shortly."
3808,en,1,808,1,0.86069,positive,,positive,0.858343,"This portfolio is backed by differentiated technology modes. That includes printers, software materials in over 260 patents issued or pending. We have a second major mode around distribution. And we now have over 250 partners in 68 countries around the world. We are doubling down on a combination of horizontal and vertical focus. We are the channel to go after a variety of markets. We have got a solid dental and jewelry business and we will continue to expand our focus into verticals such as healthcare, automotive, aerospace and oil and gas. We have got a very compelling financial profile. The products I highlighted earlier each have high margin recurring revenue streams from receivables and service, which generate a multiple of the upfront revenue and gross profit over the lifetime of the system."
3809,en,1,534,1,0.894435,positive,,positive,0.856968,"On the whole, we anticipate significant gross margin improvements and operating leverage as we scale revenue over time. And finally, we believe there is a significant inorganic upside potential in the business. And we have got a team with experience executing transactions. We have ended the year with a very robust liquidity profile. And we expect to use this to fund organic activities, but also generate a return as we add strategic capabilities to the business in line with a strategy focused on enabling killer apps for additive."
3810,en,1,438,1,0.729403,positive,,positive,0.5056,"Taking a step back, you look at the additive manufacturing industry as a whole on Slide 4, today, a small percentage of the spend in a program goes to design prototypes, tooling and jigs and fixtures. These use cases has traditionally been the focus of additive manufacturing. This actually used to be an industry called rapid prototyping, but the vast majority of the spending in a program really goes to the end use parts in production."
3811,en,1,1281,1,0.306491,positive,1,positive,0.431828,"Turning to Slide 5, if you take additive manufacturing, or AM to mass production, there is four key hurdles, each has a high bar given the maturity of conventional manufacturing processes. In the polymer space, for example, surface finish has traditionally been a barrier. I mean parts that look and feel like end use parts or the polymer AM has created this hurdle, but for a long time, the parts didn’t have the required accuracy. Today, there are residents available that fully cured during printing. So, you can achieve the finish and accuracy needed to go to market with AM parts. Material properties is also a recent area of innovation with multicolor resins, which now enable making parts from materials that level or exceed widely available thermoplastics. And finally, beads have gradually been increasing since about 2011 primarily through continuous printing, which we patented and they are now reaching a point where you can use photopolymer AM production in high volumes. The story is very similar in the metal side, where over time technology advances have cleared each of these bars. The key hurdle we at, DM, are now addressing the speed and cost where throughput has historically emitted the use of metal AM, because parts and systems have not been cost effective."
3812,en,1,852,1,0.795149,positive,,positive,0.730595,"Turning to Slide 6, we are focused on print processes with productivity that continues to improve over time, writing semiconductor scaling loss. In metals, we have got the fastest binder jetting systems in the market. The engine that drives the throughput is inkjet, which has doubled in throughput every roughly 18 to 24 months. For the past 20 years, by improving nozzle density and droplet firing frequency, whereas vector-based print processes typically require more time or more cost to scale through. An area-wide process that gains efficiencies over time like our proprietary single pass jetting technology drives the economics of additive down the cost curve to make it competitive with conventional manufacturing and volumes up to hundreds of thousands of units per day and even larger volumes as the new generation print engine is introduced."
3813,en,1,977,1,0.817101,positive,,positive,0.827571,"On Slide 7, we see the same thing happening in photopolymers, with the move to UV diodes as a light source for curing. EnvisionTEC’s photopolymer printers have scaled speed roughly every 24 months as new generations of diodes come out. Now, you have got their new patented approach called projection arrays, which multiplies improvements in power output enables sprint speeds to scale it even faster. Resolution has also had scaling with rapid advancements in underlying image projection technology. This allows you to have larger built platforms with more parts. The result of all this is that our photopolymer printers can now use these improvements in power and resolution to shift further the cost curve making at-scale printing of end use polymer parts viable. With this focus on technologies that ride third-party improvements in efficiency and power, we have the wind behind our sales and we anticipate growing more competitive with conventional manufacturing each year."
3814,en,1,969,1,0.59994,positive,1,positive,0.698626,"Turning to Slide 8, additive manufacturing 2.0 or AM 2.0 represents this next generation of technologies that enables volume production of end use parts with finish, accuracy, properties and economics that are actually competitive with conventional manufacturing. The AM market has compounded at 20% annually over the last decade to $12 billion by 2019. In the last 3 years before 2019, it actually compounded at 25% annually. We think the market overall exhibited a strong bounce back from COVID-19 in the fourth quarter and that points to a promising year ahead. And the industry is expected to continue to compound at roughly 25% over the next decade to get to $146 billion by 2030. This inflection is really being driven by more and more businesses shifting towards end use parts powered by AM 2.0. And that $146 billion only represents 1% penetration of the overall $12 trillion in the global manufacturing industry. So there is plenty of room to continue to grow."
3815,en,1,1217,1,0.389845,positive,1,positive,0.501712,"Turning to Slide 9, the reason so many businesses are looking to use additive for end-use parts is that it eliminates the need for tooling, which has created significant pain points in conventional manufacturing. For example, long lead times, minimum volume requirements, time sensitive machine programming, and significant material waste. Conventional manufacturing also creates design limitations that can negatively impact performance and cost in favor of manufacturability. Additive enables benefits like the ability to design complex parts using generative design tools that optimized for real world physics or assembly consolidation, which takes many components and prints them as a single part with dramatic efficiencies on weight or performance or mass customization of parts to particular markets or environments. Finally, reengineering supply chains are on demand, flexible manufacturing capacity and digital inventories, where businesses ship files across borders for local manufacturing. There is a dramatic opportunity to reshape global commerce and improve CO2 footprints as we develop more efficient ways to mass produce and ship products to consumers. And these are key long-term tailwinds for AM 2.0."
3816,en,1,586,1,0.482874,positive,1,positive,0.506822,"I would like to spend some time to highlight some exciting initial applications that are becoming cost effective with our AM 2.0 solutions. In the past, you have probably heard of additive being used for very high end, very low volume parts like genetic components. I think one of the problems with additive is it costs too much to be used at scale in larger markets. One of the more exciting things about our solutions is that we can now use AM 2.0 technologies to make hundreds of thousands of parts in applications that you never would have considered using additive for in the past."
3817,en,1,1380,1,0.748222,positive,,positive,0.852938,"On Slide 10, you can see one of our customers, for example, a company called E.A.C. in France. They are a major supplier of metal accessories for swimwear, cosmetics and luxury goods for companies such as Chanel and Louis Vitton. More and more, they are using our shop system to mass produce pieces they can end up in stores that you as a consumer could go to and purchase. That is a fantastic, fantastic development for additive. They have received their system middle of last quarter and it’s already making parts in high volume. The shop system helped E.A.C increase their hardware production from 10,000 pieces per week to more than 70,000 parts per week. Those are real manufacturing numbers. Tens of thousands of pieces per week, shop system also allows them to create volume quantities of these accessories, which significantly reduced lead times, which is important in the fashion industry and minimal to no manual assembly required. This is a game changer for an SME business like this that’s supplying end-use parts to a market. And it illustrates several core benefits of the shop system biogenic solution, turnkey flexible manufacturing, volume production of real end-use parts with faster time to market and the ability to get up and running quickly with minimal prior binder jetting experience. As a plug and play solution, it’s extremely easy to install and deploy."
3818,en,1,826,1,0.870063,positive,,positive,0.876596,"On Slide 11, another exciting case study is with one of our P-1 customers, FreeFORM Technologies. They have got a very experienced team in Pennsylvania and are dedicating themselves to making parts with metal binder jetting. To the P-1, the part quality and throughput has enabled them to continually gain business with their customers fulfilling small quantities of parts at first and then go into a large volume and because it’s a digital manufacturing process that can economically turnaround thousands of parts in 1 to 2 weeks versus 2 to 3 months with conventional manufacturing or older generation AM systems at 75% to 90% reduction in lead time. On top of supporting direct material and process transfers to flagship production, P-50, the P-1 is a great tool for high-speed serial production of small and complex parts."
3819,en,1,1074,1,0.89861,positive,,positive,0.85582,"Turning to Slide 12, since the fourth quarter, we also entered a fast growing photopolymer additive market, with our acquisition of EnvisionTEC, the original inventor of digital light processing, or DLP printing, an area wide photopolymer 3D printing process. They have significant blocking IP in this segment, which has bolstered our DM patent portfolio. Together, we created a one-stop shop for AM 2.0 solutions across polymers and metals. What we are excited about with EnvisionTEC is that their solutions have been used to produce end use parts at scale, with over 10 million parts in 2020 alone. They are market leader in fast growing segments like dental with sales of their Envision One platform grew over 3x in 2020 despite the challenges from COVID-19. EnvisionTEC gives us a fantastic platform as we expand the business to reach a whole new set of verticals and applications that benefit from polymer parts and volume. And on top of this, we grow our channel in both number and geographic reach with great opportunity for cross-selling metal and polymer solutions."
3820,en,1,790,1,0.687959,positive,1,positive,0.760462,"Looking at the product portfolio as a whole on Slide 13, we feel it’s the most compelling and diverse set of AM 2.0 solutions in the market and it can cater to metals, composites, ceramics, photopolymers, and even include digital casting and bio-printing capabilities. And what’s great is that it can address use cases across a product lifecycle from preproduction all the way to volume end use parts. This is a killer product lineup. Almost all of these products have been refreshed and released during the last year and we believe they can take us to significant scale. They are backed by a very strong IP portfolio of over 260 issued and pending patents and supported by a library of over 190 materials. To build these products, we really had to pioneer a set of disruptive technologies."
3821,en,1,1140,1,0.801788,positive,1,positive,0.80116,"On Slide 14 now, Single Pass Jetting is the patent pending technology that powers our production system platform. Unlike competitive binder jetting systems, which typically require 20 to 30 seconds to print a layer, the production system P-1 and P-50 can print a letter in under 3 seconds. This equates to build speeds that are up to 100 times faster than part of a fusion and significantly faster than conventional binder jetting. The P-50 can support production of up to millions of parts annually at costs that are competitive with conventional manufacturing at reasonable volumes and this is really key because business won’t adopt additive if it can compete on cost. The production system platform offers the only inner processing environment in the market. So we are actually able to print reactive materials we have binder jet. As an example with great announcement last week on a breakthrough in the development of aluminum for binder jetting, where we have collaborated with our partners to achieve extremely promising results of over 99% dense 6061 aluminum material with properties better than lot with comparable heat treatment."
3822,en,1,800,1,0.89675,positive,,positive,0.899603,"On the metal side, we have also got advanced print technology was developed in-house to be affordable and easy to install. It makes binder jetting an accessible turnkey solution that can be adopted rapidly by businesses and individuals without experience with printing or metallurgy. Both of these technologies are enabled by life center, our proprietary sintering simulation software designed to improve our accuracy and eliminate the trial and error for powder metallurgy based additive manufacturing. It dynamically stimulates the sintering step of a binder jetting process to predict shrinkage and distortion, incorrect geometries before printing to minimize any deviations from the intended design of the final part. This software tool will be a key enabler for broad adoption of binder jetting."
3823,en,1,1330,1,0.857778,positive,,positive,0.831237,"Turning to Slide 15, on the photopolymer side, we have a unique patented technology in continuous digital ad manufacturing. This is an extremely cost effective solution for mass production of photopolymer parts that uses proprietary domeless basement technology to provide higher accuracy prints than membrane alternatives. The Envision One HT, which began shipping in the first quarter of 2021, is the only commercially available high temperature high viscosity photopolymer system shipping in volume today. And we think this is the future in photopolymer AM. This technology allows businesses to achieve properties on par or exceeding conventional thermoplastics. And these systems are doing extremely well. On the right here is the new Xtreme 8K solution, which uses patented protection array technology to achieve native 8K resolution and effective 16L resolution at very high speeds. It’s the most advanced polymer AM system in the market compared to an industrial Fortus 450 FDM printer from Stratasys. This system is up to 100x faster with a build envelope that’s roughly the same size. And it offers superior price performance to comparable industrial polymer AM systems. And just like the Envision One HT, it supports high temperature, high viscosity resins to enable a wide variety of industrial commercial applications."
3824,en,1,678,1,0.884268,positive,,positive,0.88459,"Digging into our go-to-market on Slide 16, we have got a leading global distribution network today, with over 200 partners that can sell and service our solutions in over 68 countries around the world. Our partners address a wide variety of markets and include vertically focused players as well as the ones focused on general industrial businesses. They can support a variety of business models and product offerings whether it’s low touch high volume or high touch high value. We think this is one of the differentiating assets of DM as a company. And we believe this will be a key factor in accelerating our growth to achieve global scale and launch new products efficiently."
3825,en,1,409,1,0.910871,positive,,positive,0.899757,"Turning to Slide 17, we have got a very broad adoption of our AM 2.0 technologies across a variety of industries in both polymers and metals, healthcare, automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and consumer products, diversified manufacturers and machine shops. We are excited to expand this user base to more blue chip customers and SMEs as we continue to ramp production in distribution over our newer solutions."
3826,en,1,622,1,0.773544,positive,1,positive,0.693035,"Turning to Slide 18, the unit economics of these products are fantastic. The two examples here are the production system, P-50 and the Xtreme 8K. The lifetime revenue and gross profit of each system is a multiple of the initial sale, roughly 3x to $6.5 million in the case of a P-50 and upwards of 10x to $1.5 billion with the Xtreme 8K. The current contribution comes from the sale of high margin consumables and services, which result in strong gross margin profiles over the life of the system, but they really demonstrate a pretty attractive razor, razor blade model, where the initial sale generates a profit as well."
3827,en,1,805,1,0.898484,positive,,positive,0.864704,"Turning for a moment to our strategy related to inorganic growth on Slide 19, there is an opportunity here as we continue to build out a strong distribution channel to bring new technologies on the printer side that are focused on AM 2.0. There is a lot of innovation in the private sector and we look forward to adding new print capabilities to our company to enable a wider set of applications and use cases. The second vector for inorganic growth is materials, where we see a huge opportunity to benefit from vertical integration. We have already built vertically integrated structure for materials in the photopolymer side, where we also have an open certified materials business model to work with partners with unique materials outside our moat to offer validated third-party solutions to customers."
3828,en,1,1022,1,0.640467,positive,,positive,0.772896,"On the metal side vertically integrating into advanced materials difficult for conventional manufacturing could uplift the lifetime value of a P-50 customer by up 2x to 6x. The third vector for inorganic growth is building a strong parts offering around killer app where our focus is to incorporate businesses and segments with high margin high barriers to entry. And you will see more about our strategy in this area as the year progresses and we have secured some of these transactions. We believe this can be very accretive to the company and provide a strong return on capital as in the case with EnvisionTEC. Now, there are already several markets which have been quick to adopt AM at scale and we are going to focus on building go-to-market strategies about each of these segments. Hearing aids, for example, is an application that has almost fully crossed over into additive. The same goes for jewelry where AM is used widely for creating wax molds for casting and now starting to be used for direct metal printing."
3829,en,1,1139,1,0.862253,positive,,positive,0.886873,"Turning to Slide 20, today, we are now seeing the creation of a new business called Desktop Health focused on patient-specific additive manufacturing solutions for the healthcare and dental markets. To help lead this initiative, we are bringing on board Mike Jafar, who had a historic career at Evolus in Allergan, launching some of the best known brands in the healthcare space. We feel there are commercial ready applications in dental, orthopedics, audiology and surgical instruments, but there is also a lot of exciting potential in our untapped categories. And we look forward to working with Mike and his team to evolve solutions for these applications and bring them to the market using our DLP, high speed metal binder jetting in Bioplotter solutions. Our vision here is that today you have got more than $85 billion of medical implants annually and they are mostly produce in standard manufactured sizes. We think that’s going to change over the next decade or two where most of these parts will become patient specific and that’s a major opportunity for additive manufacturing across metals, polymers, ceramics and all materials."
3830,en,1,963,1,0.783519,positive,,positive,0.733504,"On Slide 21, dental is one of the killer apps for additive manufacturing. It’s a segment that has been patient specific for some time now since every part is custom. It’s a market that’s both growing and adopting additive quite rapidly. However, with more than $30 billion in annual parts and spend in dental, only a small percentage of that total is printed. Most central parts today are still milled are made by hand in the lab. We see an excellent opportunity for additive to reach up to 75% by 2025 and we plan to be a major enabler of AM adoption in the ortho, lab in terms of dental markets. Materials are key to enabling applications in this market. You can see how many different use cases for AM there are in polymers, metals and ceramics. We have got several materials that have either received FDA 510(k) clearance or are in process, including proprietary materials for permanent crowns and full arch implant dentures with industry leading performance."
3831,en,1,636,1,0.874351,positive,,positive,0.877185,"Turning on to Slide 22, we believe the future is to have processes that take less time where you can remove the temporary steps. An example is full arch implant dentures, which is a procedure that today takes an average 3 weeks from beginning to end. Enabled by our breakthrough proprietary materials and combined with our high speed printers, we developed with our partners a revolutionary same day digital workflow for full arch implant dentures. This new 3D printed smile takes place in a single day under the comfort of IV sedation. And this will be one of several initial solutions that we will bring to market with Desktop Health."
3832,en,1,924,1,0.89402,positive,,positive,0.881439,"Our materials and process have been tested in a clinical study conducted in coordination with leading partners in the field in participation from roughly 900 patients this March 2000. Since then, there have been no failures with our printed implant dentures and the results overall have been excellent. This application is part of roughly $4 billion dental implant market, where we feel there is potential to completely revolutionize how patients are treated and this is all enabled by a combination of advanced materials in both metals and polymers with really high-quality properties and AM technologies suitable for end use part production. We look forward to building a best-in-class team in healthcare and dental to work with our partners in industry to bring patient specific solutions to the market at scale, not just in dental, but also across cardiology, orthopedics, ophthalmology, dermatology and plastic surgery."
3833,en,1,1028,1,0.893248,positive,,positive,0.847308,"Now, turning to our fourth quarter business highlights on Slide 24. As I mentioned earlier, we made several key strides in the fourth quarter towards commercializing our AM 2.0 technology platform. We started global shipments of our Shop System, a mass market binder jetting solution for SMEs and machine shops. It’s a full turnkey offering designed for flexible mid volume production. Based on published figures, in just one quarter in the market, Shop System became the number one selling binder system in terms of units. In addition, we begin global shipments of our production system, P-1 solution, the entry level model for our production system platform. It’s also a great proof point on our path to commercializing the production system, P-50 in the second half of 2021 as to show the same technology architecture and corporate modules. We are incredibly proud of our dedicated team of employees that helped us achieve these key product launches in spite of the challenges and disruptions created by COVID-19 during 2020."
3834,en,1,474,1,0.67145,positive,1,positive,0.681476,"Among our commercialization products, we gain adoption from key customers such as Milwaukee Tool, Ford, Eaton, Pratt and Whitney, and more. We also launched our sintering simulation software live center, for using our binder jetting solutions and received significant awards from the Department of Defense. We beefed up our Board of Directors with the addition of Scott Dussault as Veteran CFO and Steve Nigro, who used to be President of HP’s printing and imaging business."

I am pleased for this opportunity to share Desktop Metal’s financial results for the first time as a public company. I will begin with a quick recap for those new to Desktop Metal before providing a summary of the company’s fourth quarter and full year results for 2020 and closing with guidance for 2021, which can be found on Slide 25. We announced a definitive business combination agreement with Trine Acquisition Corp on August 26, 2020 concurrently with a successful PIPE fundraise that in aggregate provided approximately $530 million of net proceeds to our balance sheet. The business combination was completed on December 9 and we began trading on the NYSE on the 10th under the ticker symbol, DM."
3838,en,1,687,1,0.703596,positive,1,positive,0.708035,"Moving to our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflected an inflection point in our business as we successfully commenced shipments of several new products. We generated revenue of $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, up from $2.5 million in the third quarter and in line with our expectation of sequential acceleration. Casting sales in the fourth quarter was $10 million resulting in gross margin of negative 20%.

I was wondering, Ric, looking back at the last – I guess we are at 7 or 8 months now since you announced the transaction and guidance at that point, which I think was $15 million to $25 million in revenue for 2020. Can you talk a bit about what headwinds you faced? What you are seeing from the market in terms of reception to some of the launches?

We didn’t get to ship our Shop System until probably middle or second half of the fourth quarter and the traditional COVID supply chain related thing, so moving things around the world, but we did a global launch in all continents, which I think was a strategic thing for us to get going on our Shop System and we did that to prevent potential limitations of different places that we didn’t know whether they would be locked down or not. Overall, we are pretty happy with the results given all the traditional challenges that our companies faced to get products delivered around the world. And I think that as we come out of pandemic, we are going to see some great resurgence and people going back to their labs and manufacturing spaces to execute programs, so."

We are pretty happy with the way studios continue to develop it’s now starting to ship and Shop System continued acceleration on that and P-1s as well. So it’s the product that we have been describing. I think as we go through the rest of the year, we will have a progression that’s similar to what you see in our industry, which is Q2 and Q4 probably the landmark quarters in additive and then Q1 is usually a refresh from the beginning of the year.

It is doing extremely well in the market and in the particularly in dental labs of all the segments we continue to see significant traction and adoption on it as well as for D4K for chairside and it’s – we think the products are fantastic.

So, it sounds like in Q4, there were still some kind of COVID related headwinds and maybe some push-outs in terms of timing, I guess, looking at the revenue guide, I thought maybe given some of those new product introductions, then obviously, you have got contribution from EnvisionTEC that revenue would have jumped or at least the guy that would have suggested a revenue jump more sequentially.

However, it is something that we do selectively. We acquire things that give us new capabilities in either print modalities for AM 2.0 or vertically integrated into materials or consumables that our systems use, particular in high volume production applications. And then on the product side, we have got a strategy to enabling printing of difficult to manufacture materials, which require specialized processing as well as killer apps where their significant IP or high margin markets. And so we are going to continue to execute that and you would see transactions in the future as that goes on. I would say, we looked at a lot of business opportunities. It’s not uncommon for companies that just went through – what we went through to see a lot of things and so we are very selective in what we actually move forward with, but we are excited about the things that we have got in front of us and think we can do very accretive transactions."

Today, most parts that are used in healthcare are not patient specific, with the exception of dentistry, where the clips are made by hand for patients. So, when you buy a graft or an implant, it’s traditionally something that was producing 4, 5 or 10 sizes and then the surgeons try to match it at the time of surgery. And I think that a decade or two from now, everything will be patient specific and based on everything, probably with the exception of trauma, which needs real-time inventory. But I think that, that presents a very unique opportunity to develop a core competency in the business and we are building a world class go-to-market team that’s going to develop clear products as well as help our partners in the healthcare industry adopt this technology at scale. We are going to be very creative in the types of products that we are going to help our partners bring to market. And I am excited to share those as we evolve it, but I think it’s going to be a very vibrant part of our business, I expect it to be at least a third of our business in the long run. So, it’s a great area where end use products can do very well. And I think you will see the healthcare industry adopt additive at scale over the next decade."

3896,en,1,1370,1,0.830616,positive,,positive,0.838461,"Yes, it continues to grow. I think we have a great synergy between our P-1 and P-50. Most customers that buy a P-1 no longer want to have a P-50. So, it’s an on-ramp to that platform. It was actually developed in concert with a major customer who bought a P-50, but need a P-1 type machine in order to qualify materials and parts without having to get a P-50 like machine sort of pulled from production in order to do a qualification of our components. So, if you are going to mass produce, if you are a large company, you have got 10,000 SKUs, 5,000 SKUs that you would want to print, you need a platform to qualify those while you have got the large CapEx printing 24/7. And that’s how we see the synergy between those two architectures, settings or qualification that you are doing on P-1 translate to 100% to a P-50. They have the same modules and the same inkjet systems, the same recording process. So, it’s a one-to-one and we validated that with some of our customers that have both installed beta of P-50 and have received the P-1. And I think that P-1 is a much small machine. So, it’s easier to install and deploy, but it’s a great platform, it’s going to help us mature that technology to the point where it’s you have got high OEE by the time we deploy your P-50 into the market later this year. So, we are excited about how those two systems play together."

3900,en,1,2115,1,0.720374,positive,,positive,0.719385,"I think there are – I mean, obviously, you would have to update the models when we do the transactions. Some of the companies we are going to acquire are more technically oriented and sort of capabilities on our technology that would allow us to have future products. And some of them are companies that have some scale like EnvisionTEC and an installed base that we are then going to provide additional distribution or help us scale faster. So, I think that depends on the transaction. And we have several things that we are working on. So as we execute them, we would love to explain the opportunity and why we did, what we did and then I think there is a great opportunity in bringing AM 2.0 technologies into the market. One thing that I think is a focus of us is we are not going to do any acquisitions on sort of tooling or take some pictures or things that we would consider AM 1.0. I mean, our market grew in sort of a rapid prototyping tooling type of world and our company is 100% focused on mass production of end use parts. So there is a lot of folks that would like to claim that there is the same thing, but there is sort of two ways of playing this market. One is to take a technology that’s helped patents, for example, like FDM and develop a more modern version of that for smaller markets like tooling and jigs and fixtures. Another one is to really tackle the issue of how do you go to mass production at scale with additive and we are 100% focused on what we call AM 2.0, which is the production of additive parts at scale, at a lower cost structure than conventional manufacturing, where the economics are the driver. So, that’s 100% the focus on the company and all of our M&A strategies and execution focus is geared towards making additive cost effective. The systems cost too much today to bring to market and older technologies is not cost effective on a cost per part basis. So, the focus on the company is 100% on the combination of techniques that give you a combination of surface finish, accuracy, material properties and throughput, so you can actually go to market with 3D printing."

And so I was just trying to understand sort of if you look at that bridge, how much of that is coming from EnvisionTEC versus some kind of continued headwinds associated with COVID as we look from I think going from around roughly $31 million loss, including some of those public company costs versus the guidance you provided.

Beyond that, I really view it as additional investment in the business, I mean, really as I stated with near $600 million of dry powder, we could essentially just go status quo when – and leave their funds in the bank near zero interest. But instead, we are doing everything we can to accelerate some of those longer term financial targets. So, that is how I would be thinking about it. In terms of EnvisionTEC, no, that is not really a drain on EBITDA, if you will, it’s a transaction that, as I mentioned, our primary focus is to acquire good technology with EnvisionTEC, we certainly got that. We did also get some good stable revenues and a healthy bottom line as well. So, really, it’s more about accelerating the growth story."

And then kind of related to the last question, I understand you kind of said, you are maybe not in the point where you could talk about the longer term business models, but maybe going back to the EBITDA question, if you would be comfortable kind of talking about generally when you are thinking about maybe hitting a breakeven point or maybe profitability?

4084,en,1,713,1,0.889255,positive,1,positive,0.888602,"Thank you, Julia. Good morning and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In 2020, we delivered one of the most successful years in the company's history. It was truly a transformational year, with the accelerated approval of Monjuvi, as the first and only second-line treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. We are incredibly proud of this achievement. As this is just the beginning and we are looking forward to building momentum over time. We believe tafasitamab has the potential to transform the standard of care in DLBCL, and will lead to a paradigm shift in how patients will B cell malignancies are treated."
4085,en,1,673,1,0.865196,positive,,positive,0.85802,"We are looking to rapidly expand the tafasitamab opportunity through label expansion and exploring tafasitamab in combination with other approved or emerging compounds. The execution in brining this important breakthrough therapy to the market for patients has created a strong foundation for MorphoSys as in integrated commercial biopharmaceutical company. Throughout the year, we continue to progress and expand our pipeline in the areas of hematology, oncology, and autoimmune diseases. We presented very encouraging preliminary Phase 1b data from our first-line study in first-line DLBCL that paves the way to initiate our pivotal front-line study in the coming months."
4086,en,1,752,1,0.834759,positive,,positive,0.837819,"Turning to business development activities, at the start of 2020, we entered into an important global commercial and development partnership with Incyte, for tafasitamab. We are excited that we entered into a development collaboration with Xencor to evaluate the combination of tafasitamab with Xencor's bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody, plamotamab, aiming to help more patients with certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma. And shifting gears to our financials for the year, we reported very solid results, with revenue of roughly €320 million, and EBIT €27 million. Revenue in part included €18.5 million from the product sales of Monjuvi. We also significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and we have completed all of this in the middle of the global pandemic."
4087,en,1,663,1,0.702787,positive,1,positive,0.647462,"Moving to slide six, our business model currently represents three pillars guiding future value creation. The first pillar will drive value from our own commercialization efforts. We were excited to start booking U.S. sales for Monjuvi in the third quarter of 2020. We see great potential to expand its use by becoming a standard of care and a backbone in NHL, which will derive increased commercial opportunities. Another asset I would like to highlight in this pillar is felzartamab. It could become an attractive opportunity as a treatment for select autoimmune diseases where the unmet medical disease is high, starting with autoimmune membranous nephropathy."
4088,en,1,714,1,0.562302,positive,1,positive,0.570152,"Our second value drivers are royalties and milestones from our partnered and out-licensed programs. Our program with Janssen, Tremfya, is approved for [psoriasis] [Ph] and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., EU, and other countries. We are very pleased with the commercial success of Tremfya, and look forward to Janssen developing Tremfya for use in additional indications. Other late-stage partnered programs include GSK's otilimab for rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-related severe respiratory distress syndrome, as well as Roche's gantenerumab for Alzheimer's disease. And the third value driver is our research platform that has been the foundation for MorphoSys' success with cutting-edge antibody technologies."
4089,en,1,295,1,0.837061,positive,,positive,0.852802,"We are continually enriching it with next-generation platforms to drive further groundbreaking innovation. In November, we signed a license agreement with Cherry Biolabs for a potentially exciting next-generation Hemibody technology. We believe these three pillars will driver shareholder value."
4090,en,1,425,1,0.620212,positive,,positive,0.731549,"Moving to slide seven, our top priority is the continued execution of the Monjuvi launch, where we are very encouraged by the early progress. We continue to get positive feedback from physicians, and have maintained leading share of voice of approximately 50%. We anticipate the potential for viability for the first two-year of launch during the global pandemic, but we are confident in the long-term trajectory for Monjuvi."
4091,en,1,768,1,0.672378,positive,,positive,0.648273,"And beyond our current second-line indication, we are rapidly expanding tafasitamab in additional hematologic oncology indications, and are planning the initiation of two pivotal trials in the first-half of this year, including the initiation of a pivotal trial in first-line DLBCL called FontMIND in the coming month. The second pivotal trial called L-MIND for follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma is set to start soon. The follicular lymphoma indication received orphan designation in January of this year. With tafasitamab's differentiated profile, it has the potential to be a partner of choice. As I mentioned earlier, we are also advancing other pipeline assets, including tafasitamab, where we expect to get proof-of-concept data in the coming month."
4092,en,1,390,1,0.80881,positive,,positive,0.884075,"And finally, our disciplined capital allocation strategy is an important component as we focus on balancing investments in our internal pipeline along with potential external opportunities that are a strategic fit. 2020 was a year marked by many important accomplishments, encouraged by the approval of Monjuvi. We look forward to keeping you updated on our key initiatives during the year."
4093,en,1,86,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Roland for our commercial update."
4094,en,1,15,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Roland Wandeler
4095,en,1,617,1,0.84269,positive,,positive,0.863968,"Thank you, Jean-Paul, and hello everyone. Moving to slide nine, 2020 was indeed an exciting year for us, and one of our defining moments was the accelerated approval of Monjuvi in late July. From FDA approval through the end of December, we delivered on a rapid speed to market, achieving major launch milestones within days of approval. In fact, the first Monjuvi order, shipment, patient dose, and inclusion in NCCN guidelines all happened within the first 30 days following approval. We ensured rapid and robust payer access, and coverage for Monjuvi through commercial and government channels is well-established."
4096,en,1,419,1,0.742413,positive,,positive,0.787023,"Now, taking a closer look at Q4, the first book order for Monjuvi in the marketplace; we reported $70 million in sales for the quarter and $22 million for the year. Q4 Monjuvi sales were primarily driven by demand and also benefited from a third-party clinical trial supply order and some select NGOs inventory buying at the close of the year. The latter two factors contributed about $1 million in Monjuvi sales in Q4."
4097,en,1,840,1,0.857281,positive,,positive,0.859385,"Moving to slide 10, we were very encouraged by the continued traction we saw in the number of accounts ordering Monjuvi. During our last call, we shared that more than 250 sites of care had ordered by the end of October with 80% reordering. By the end of December, we saw a significant increase with cumulative orders from more than 400 sites since launch. Key academic centers continue to be strongly interested in Monjuvi, and we are seeing increased momentum in community care indicating the broad accessibility of Monjuvi for patients in both academic and community settings. Given that we are already quite advanced in first quarter, we want to share some reflections on the start of the year. After strong momentum in 2020 and while uptake in second line continues to increase, we saw the first months of 2021 impacted by two factors."
4098,en,1,946,1,-0.337915,negative,1,positive,0.322269,"First, the unprecedented surge in the COVID pandemic after the holidays impacted sites of care across the U.S. and limited our ability to see physicians. While they continue to maintain a leading share of voice of about 50% and see continued interest in our messages, the COVID surge slowed down our engagement of key physicians. Second, as a result of the winter storms across the U.S. in February, we expect some patients in their early cycles have their treatment temporarily interrupted. These factors may impact our Q1 results. However, we are seeing treatment levels in the last few weeks return to the momentum we built at the end of 2020. In fact, we are very encouraged by the feedback we are receiving from prescribers, especially the physicians who saw our two year data for second-line patients at ASH are intrigued by the long duration of response. The appropriate indication of prescribers with this data is a priority for our team."
4099,en,1,660,1,0.652832,positive,,positive,0.723845,"Our focus in 2021 is to lay the foundation for long-term growth. We expect the gradual build from Monjuvi as we drive increased uptake in second-line, and as patients who respond to continue treatment to progression over time. Monjuvi safe and tolerability profile together with its duration of response, support the paradigm shift in the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Our treatment regimen to treat patients with Monjuvi to progression makes the two year long-term data relevant not only for patient benefit, but also from a business perspective. And we are looking forward to sharing with you is three year long-term data in an upcoming conference."
4100,en,1,394,1,0.59287,positive,1,positive,0.623521,"As we continue to establish Monjuvi as the standard of care for appropriate patients with relapse/refractory DLBCL, who are progressing from first-line and are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. We never lose sight that nearly 10,000 DLBCL patients in the U.S. could benefit from the promise of Monjuvi each year. It is our mission to bring this important new treatment for them."
4101,en,1,65,1,0.97993,positive,,positive,0.988731,Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to my colleague Malte.
4102,en,1,12,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Malte Peters
4103,en,1,368,1,0.907181,positive,,positive,0.931953,"Thank you, Roland. As Jean-Paul and Roland have mentioned, we are very proud of all our accomplishments in 2020, highlighted by the U.S. approval of Monjuvi. We have achieved FDA approval with an innovative approach in record time with a second-line labor, which is the foundation of making Monjuvi available for many patients suffering from relapsed/refractory DLBCL."
4104,en,1,286,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,I would now like to concentrate on the outlook for this year 2021. And let me start with tafasitamab. The key areas of focus for 2021 are rapidly extending the tafasitamab opportunity by label expansion and exploring tafasitamab in combination with other approved or emerging compounds.
4105,en,1,537,1,0.754657,positive,,positive,0.754338,"Regarding the evolving L-MIND data, the durability of responses is an important differentiator for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL treated with Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide. Data from the two-year cut off showed a median duration of response of close to three years, along with a median overall survival of 31.6 months. Patients in this study who achieved a complete response, have a greater than 85% chance to remain in complete remission after two years and a greater than 90% chance to be alive after two years."
4106,en,1,675,1,0.742931,positive,,positive,0.726804,"This benefit was especially pronounced for patients who are treated with Monjuvi and lenalidomide as a second-line treatment. In these patients, we could observe an overall response rate of 67.5% as well as a 24 months overall survival rate of 67.9%. These data combined with Monjuvi safety and tolerability profile support a paradigm shift for traditionally difficult to treat patients, potentially offering long-term disease control. We are looking forward to the next three-year cut off, and we are confident that we will be able to provide further evidence supporting Monjuvi's duration of response. This data will be presented at one of the upcoming medical conferences."
4107,en,1,692,1,-0.289315,negative,1,negative,-0.31466,"Beyond relapsed/refractory DLBCL our focus is on the rapid expansion of the clinical development of tafasitamab into earlier lines of treatment as well as into additional indications. It is our aim to develop tafasitamab as the backbone treatment for patients with DLBCL and other B-cell hematological malignancies. We have started to investigate tafasitamab and lenalidomide in first-line DLBCL with the aim to improve cure rates and to create a new standard of care regimen. There's a high unmet needs for DLBCL patients in the first-line setting, especially those at high-risk with an IPI score of three to five. For these patients, the chances of cure with R-CHOP alone are less than 50%."
4108,en,1,384,1,0.563709,positive,1,positive,0.501912,"We presented the initial results of our First-MIND Phase 1b study at ASH at the end of last year. And we are very encouraged that the study showed an initial response rate of 91.1% in a patient population that overall had a poor prognosis. The results also showed that the combination of tafasitamab/lenalidomide and R-CHOP did not show unexpected toxicity, which is very encouraging."
4109,en,1,265,1,0.7915,positive,,positive,0.802884,"We completed enrollment in the First-MIND study one month ahead of schedule, which shows the great interest in this potential treatment options. We will provide a more detailed update of this data including CR and PR rate at a medical conference in the near future."
4110,en,1,864,1,0.569001,positive,1,positive,0.669335,"The First-MIND data are the basis for our Phase 3 study, frontMIND, and we are on track to start this study soon. frontMIND will enroll up to 900 patients and will evaluate the tafasitamab/lenalidomide combination in addition to R-CHOP compared to R-CHOP alone. We believe we can make a difference by adding this potent synergistic combination starting treatment promptly within 28 days and focusing on high risk patients. Our ambition is to improve cure rates in DLBCL in all treatment lines. Beyond DLBCL, we will expand the use of tafasitamab into other indications and plan to start a pivotal study in indolent lymphoma, another area with high unmet needs, particularly for high risk patients. We are planning to inMIND study of the tafasitamab/lenalidomide combination in patients with follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma in the first-half of 2021."
4111,en,1,565,1,0.47279,positive,1,positive,0.511553,"Tafasitamab is uniquely suited as a combination partner and a backbone of choice given its safety profile. Therefore, we are excited to evaluate the combination of tafasitamab with Xencor's bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody, plamotamab in patients with relapsed refractory DLBCL, front-line DLBCL, and relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma aiming to help more patients in this area of high unmet medical needs. Insight just leading development efforts evaluating the combination of tafasitamab with PI3 kinase delta inhibitor, parsaclisib, in a proof-of-concept study."
4112,en,1,219,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"In addition, there is increasing interest from other companies to assess tafasitamab in combination with their compounds. As an example, Karyopharm is testing tafasitamab in combination with selinexor in DLBCL patients."
4113,en,1,444,1,0.93942,positive,,positive,0.937973,"To conclude on tafasitamab, we are excited about the progress we have made regarding our comprehensive development program. We are also very proud of how we have transformed our R&D organization during the submission and approval process of Monjuvi. We can now say that we are in full swing of launching large pivotal trials with labeling expansion intent, which would it be some foundation for bringing Monjuvi to as many patients as possible."
4114,en,1,514,1,-0.807229,negative,,negative,-0.784601,"Now on slide 13, turning to felzartamab, our anti CD38 antibody that we believe has the potential to have an impact for patients with autoimmune diseases. With this anti CD38 antibody, we specifically target plasma cells. The source of auto antibodies and therefore potentially provides a targeted treatment for patients. Felzartamab is currently being evaluated in the M-PLACE study in patients with autoimmune membranous nephropathy or AMN disease that impact 10,000 patients per year in the United States alone."
4115,en,1,678,1,0.432317,positive,1,positive,0.46208,"The fact that 30% to 40% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 5 to 15 years underscores the high unmet need in this indication. We have made progress with our M-PLACE study despite a brief pause due to COVID. And we anticipate having data in the first-half of this year. We are prepared to move forward with a comprehensive development strategies and have therefore already started as scheduled findings study new place to define the optimal regimen. In addition, we will expand the program in other autoimmune diseases. And lastly, our partner I-Mab is developing felzartamab for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and is currently running two pivotal trials."

The data suggests an important clinical benefit of otilimab in a predefined subgroup of high risk patients, namely patients that are 70 years or older. Given the urgent public health needs, GSK has amended the OSCAR study to expand this cohort to confirm these potentially significant findings."

The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of Monjuvi sales, which came in at €14.1 million and €18.5 million for the full-year. Royalties from net sales of Tremfya in the fourth quarter were €12.1 million and €42.5 million for the full-year."
4121,en,1,492,1,0.479922,positive,1,positive,0.569314,"Turning to expenses, cost of sales was €9.4 million in the fourth quarter and €9.2 million for the full-year. For the full-year, cost of sales benefited €9.9 million from the reversal of inventory impairments taken in the prior-year. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were €54.8 million and €141.4 million for the full-year. Growth over 2019 reflects primarily the increased investment to support the advancement of our proprietary programs and impairment charges taken against legacy deals."
4122,en,1,285,1,0.762344,positive,,positive,0.78237,SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were €47 million and €159.1 million for the full-year. The full-year growth was anticipated and driven by the build out of the commercial infrastructure to prepare for and launch Monjuvi and investments to support the overall growth of the business.
4123,en,1,478,1,0.916048,positive,1,positive,0.675965,"For 2020, we reported a consolidated net profit of €97.9 million compared to a net loss of €103 million in 2019. Profitability in 2020 was driven primarily by the recognition of €236.1 million as part of the upfront consideration from our partner Incyte. We ended the year with a liquidity position of more than €1.2 billion compared to €357.4 million at the end of 2019. With our strong balance sheet and cash position, we're well capitalized to execute on our growth strategy."

This forecast includes the recently announced €16 million milestone payments from GSK. The range also captures the potential for variability from the first full-year of the Monjuvi product launch and the impact from the pandemic, which we believe will be greater in the first-half of this year. Operating expenses, inclusive of Incyte's share of Monjuvi selling costs, are anticipated to be in the range of €355 million to €385 million, with R&D expenses expected to comprise 45% to 50% of this range."

4134,en,1,587,1,0.791746,positive,1,positive,0.779207,"Thank you very much. Appreciate the questions and the clarity. So, a couple for Sung, if we could, on the guidance, so first, dumb question, but is your operating expense guidance including cost of goods. Secondly, is your gross margin profile for Q4 likely to be where you will be going forward? And then, just in terms of your SG&A, it implies that your SG&A is roughly going to be flat at the fourth quarter level, I believe. So I just want to clarify that. And then lastly, if you do secure approval in the EU for Monjuvi, would you expect there to be a milestone payment? Thank you."

4136,en,1,704,1,0.47496,positive,1,positive,0.562279,"Great. Geoff, thanks for all those questions. And please remind me if I have skipped one. But your first question, about COG, that is not part of our operating expense. So just to be clear, operating expense is R&D and SG&A expenses. In terms of gross margin percent, I think this will be relatively stable as we're exiting last year. We don't see that much variability this year. And I can even provide some additional color on that. For this year, you can expect it to be in the mid-to-high 70s, okay. And that's product gross margin. In terms of sales expenses or SG&A, you had mentioned that Q4 -- could we expect it to be basically the run rate of Q4. I think you're thinking about it the right way."
4137,en,1,660,1,0.703639,positive,,positive,0.867325,"And basically, as the increase in SG&A is largely driven by the full-year impact of the Monjuvi selling expenses. And these were not built at the same time in 2020. So, there's a staggering effect in 2020 and we just expect to see the full-year impact of that. And then in terms of milestones, for the potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU, I think is a very important question, and I'd like to make this very clear. That event, of potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU, does not trigger any milestone payments to MorphoSys. Further to that, the initiation of the front-line study for first-line DLBCL, that also would not trigger a milestone to MorphoSys."
4138,en,1,332,1,0.689365,positive,1,positive,0.683645,"And just to wrap up the response, I think the last two points, the milestones. As I've come into my seat and taken a fresh look at the various estimates out there in the investor community, that seemed to be the biggest area of disconnect. So, hopefully by this communication today, it demystifies the milestone story for this year."

4146,en,1,568,1,0.534095,positive,1,positive,0.586558,"Hello, James Gordon, JPMorgan. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one just on Monjuvi and the '21 implied U.S. revenue outlook. Since the guidance, if I understand it right, seems to imply that Monjuvi should do something like €65 million to €115 million for the year, and the bottom end of that seems to be only about 15% above annualizing what you already did in Q4. So, there are two questions. One is, heard the comments on Q1 headwind, do you actually think Q1 is going to see any growth on Q4 or could Q1 even be flat or down based on what you're seeing?"
4147,en,1,661,1,-0.526021,negative,1,negative,-0.495501,"I heard comments on COVID and winter storm. And for the full-year, what are you assuming about how long COVID headwinds persist for, do you think things are going to get a lot better in the second-half, or is the guidance assuming things as bad for COVID as is Q1 for the whole year? And more longer-term on Monjuvi, so I know there was a guidance before, that Monjuvi was going to hit a peak in the U.S. in refractory patients with $500 million to $750 million. I didn't see that side on the slide. So, is that being reiterated today or are you being a bit more cautious there for various reasons, including maybe competition from CD3, CD20s, or anything else?"
4148,en,1,355,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"And then just the second question would be Polivy and the Polaris first-line data coming up from Roche. So, in the event that we do get positive data there over the next few months in front-line DLBCL, what do you think that means for Monjuvi? Does that reduce the opportunity in refractory patients at all? Any thoughts like what that could mean, please?"
4149,en,1,15,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Jean-Paul Kress
4150,en,1,1066,1,0.886348,positive,,positive,0.87587,"So, James, thanks for your question. This is Jean-Paul. I'll address two and three, and Roland will come back to the Monjuvi 2021 sales. Regarding peak sales, the $500 million to $750 million you're mentioning is still our assumption. And, of course, putting some caveats on potential market share and mark evolution, this is what we have in mind now. And also, bear in mind, this is for the current indication in the United States. So, if you count on potential other territories, we should be north of 1 billion for this indication. And obviously, this doesn't include potential line extensions, other indications, and potential combinations, because, as we stated a couple of times, really important to keep in mind that part of the great potential of Monjuvi, as we see it, is the backbone strategy when we will combine with other modalities, starting with [Len] [Ph] obviously, but also with the Xencor bispecific, and potentially other modalities and compounds. In terms of your question on another event for first-line, we don't really comment on competition."
4151,en,1,731,1,0.763258,positive,1,positive,0.773244,"That being said, obviously, we watch this space very closely. And we are extremely confident in our approach for first-line based on the strengths of our regimen; probably the efficacy durability combined with our safety and convenience make us very confident that we can be a key player in first-line regardless of other events. And again, this is good news for the patients, that there will be a couple of regimen in this indication. And last, but not least, it speaks to the size of the opportunity in first-line. Bear in mind that there is 30,000 new U.S. patients every year in first-line, so no wonder why there are a couple of companies trying to cut the cord here. But again, we remain very, very confident in our approach."

We just thought that, given that we're quite forward into the quarter already, it was worth to give a heads-up regarding COVID impact and winter storm, and also to share the continued positive feedback that we're hearing from prescribers around the profile for Monjuvi, and especially those prescribers that have seen our long-term data, at ASH, for second-line patients, how intrigued they are with the duration of response."
4155,en,1,976,1,0.645395,positive,1,positive,0.643169,"Looking at the rest of this year, and at COVID, with vaccinations hopefully gaining more traction as we move forward, our team is prepared to engage healthcare professionals increasingly in person from the middle of this year, which will be important, especially with the new data that we look forward to sharing at medical conferences, in summer. And as you think about the uptake of Monjuvi, as we said before, expect a gradual build. We spoke about the 10,000 patients in the U.S., therefore, 5,000 in second-line, where we're the only ones that are approved. We are looking at an increase uptake in those second-line patients. And also, as we continue to have traction in second-line, we expect that the average duration of response, which of course is shorter in late-line patients, will continue to build over time. So, all of this ladders up to what Jean-Paul just shared regarding our outlook and potential that we see for Monjuvi, and how we are looking at this year."

My first is on Monjuvi, I believe current consensus for 2021 is about €125 million for Monjuvi. I just wanted to know if you would comment on whether the company is comfortable with that current consensus number. So that's my first question."
4161,en,1,875,1,0.574091,positive,1,positive,0.519894,"My second question just is on the OpEx guidance for the year, and I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I believe that the fourth quarter OpEx was about €111 million in total OpEx, and -- but the guidance for the year is €355 million to €385 million, so just wondering if you could reconcile if you annualize fourth quarter over €400 million, and so I just wanted to maybe get some more clarity as to how we should be thinking about SG&A and R&D. So that's my second question. And then my third question just has to do with felzartamab and the data that we're expecting. Are you comfortable this time sharing like if you do get positive data, what the potential of that asset is in other autoimmune indications, whether you've got already, internally, a list of five or 10 indications that you think felzartamab would be potentially appropriate for?

With regard to your question on the consensus Monjuvi estimates out there, obviously we come out with guidance. And obviously, there has been a reaction. And I've seen many follow-up or notes written with new ranges. I'll just simply refer you to slide 16, because I think we've laid out the revenue guidance there pretty well, where you can back into a reasonable range. For instance, the low end of our range, €150 million, the high end, €200 million; we have stated that this is inclusive of the $16 million milestone that was triggered for otilimab from GSK. We have also said that we expect moderate year-over-year growth for Tremfya. And, of course, lots here, the royalties here €42.5 million. So, we expect again, moderate growth."
4166,en,1,624,1,0.718825,positive,1,positive,0.724703,"The range does not include any other significant milestones. And as I mentioned in my first response to Geoff's question, we are not expecting any outside milestone for EU approval or the initiation of the front-line study. Now, with all those components given, I think you can reasonably get to a range. And I would say, this range, we're very comfortable with. Given, in the backdrop of COVID, we have to make sure that we accounted for a situation that persists into the second-half. And also, you have the first year of launch of Monjuvi, which comes with its own variability. So, this is a range we're comfortable with."
4167,en,1,333,1,0.285375,positive,1,negative,-0.293613,"With regard to your question on OpEx and the reconciliation of the Q4 as a proxy, Q4 operating expense was just shy of €102 million. There are some one-timers in there. So, if you back those out, that's basically how you get to a lower operating expense, vis-à-vis a run rate from Q4.

Again, this [indiscernible] modality in autoimmune diseases makes a lot of sense, because we act on the plasma cells which produce the pathogenic auto antibody, and we're very encouraged with what we've seen already in our proof-of-concept study.

4177,en,1,1360,1,0.602733,positive,1,positive,0.584299,"Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I've got three, please. So on the frontMIND, you mentioned the study starts in the next couple of months, but we've known the study design for quite a while since then, back into last year at your Monjuvi experts, when can we expect to start the drug start, if any delay purely down to COVID? And the Polarex trial you're going to be reading out in the next couple of months as well. So, are you potentially looking for, or waiting to look at what could happen there could be design of frontMIND change with the results of Polarex, that's number one. Number two, on the milestones for Monjuvi, could you give us an idea of what could you get the milestones, so it sounds like there's not a lot coming in 2021? Are the milestones, are the regulatory milestones, are they pretty much attached to approvals in front-line DLBCL, [indiscernible] and other indications. And thirdly, on your backbone strategy for Monjuvi, since obviously the Incyte deal and the Xencor deal there hadn't been a lot of activity in terms of combinations, you mentioned carry. But is it going to be on you to start a trial sort of a basket trial of potential combinations with the other CD20 assets with the other ADCs to sort of kick start that process? Or could we be hearing something later on in the year with other combinations? Thank you."

In terms of our excitement about frontMIND, we believe we have really found an optimal design of the study, combining ours with actually two targeted immunomodulatory agents tafasitamab and lenalidomide, we are very closely watching the time it requires to start treatments, we'll use good lenalidomide dose, we're concentrating on patients who are in most need of an approved treatments, namely the IPI 3 to 5 patients. And we're really encouraged by our preliminary data of firstMIND, which we have shot at ASH with an overall response rate of over 90%. And lastly, currently, we're the only meaningful Phase 3 study in front-line DLBCL. So we expect actually a very high degree of excitement regarding our frontMIND program."

Again, we're really proud and also excited about the interactions, we have made with Xencor and also with other companies regarding new and exciting combination programs, including CD20CD3 assets. The reason we started actually with Xencor was that we know Xencor very well; we have a very good and long standing and trustworthy relationship. And we're now in the process of evaluating other potential combination partners. And we take this one step at a time, a basket trial would be probably difficult because the other agents that you have mentioned are not yet approved.

To the extent that we enter a year and a milestone is significant for that year, we could talk about these because obviously, it would be material to our company in that year, but just wanting to respect the confidentiality of our agreement with our partner, I'm going to have to leave the details for the appropriate time.

4196,en,1,714,1,0.62138,positive,1,positive,0.635549,"Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Three please. So first is the clarification on OpEx. So, I think on slide 16, we can see that the OpEx of $309.7 million for 2020 includes COGS of about $9 million, but you're saying that is excluded from 2021 guidance. So just wanted to confirm if you're changing the way you define OpEx and then second on R&D, Incyte has disclosed $88 million costs related to Monjuvi development for 2020. And obviously, that's the 55% share, but is it for full-year or it's from the date the deal got completed that is sometime in March. And the last question is on your last slide, you didn't include the Xencor royalty, if you could just clarify where it sits within the Monjuvi P&L?"

4198,en,1,1200,1,0.609506,positive,1,positive,0.603436,"Sure. So, this is Sung, yes, that's a very astute observation on OpEx. So the classical definition of that I'll just define OpEx with its R&D expense and SG&A expense. And I provided separate color on cost of goods sold, or gross margin I should say, with regard to Monjuvi. So it's separated. So, I can confirm that. OpEx again, does not include any elements of cost of goods sold or cost of sales. Okay, with regard to your question on the Tafa R&D, I think you were talking about reimbursement the 55:45 split, where we pick up 45% of the development expenses and Incyte balance. I'll have to double-check this, but I believe this formula applies retroactively to a time that's before the effective date of the agreement. But I'd like to be able to verify that and follow-up with you. And then your last question with regard to the Xencor royalties. And please correct me if I got the incorrect understanding. But basically, there are royalties due to Xencor on worldwide sales. However, with regard to U.S. Monjuvi sales, the Xencor royalties factored into the profit share, okay? Ex-U.S., MorphoSys is responsible for paying the royalty to Xencor from the royalties that we received from Incyte."

Imagine we needed to tackle a legit target or universe with this first indication we might. We might decide to partner with either company with a presence in ecology. Nothing is decided, but we havethe optionality and we have the complete control on the asset."

On Monjuvi, real-world usage as you would expect in any launch in hematology, there are physicians that are having an initial trial of the medicine for later line, the last line patients that have run out of options. We've seen this happening. Having said that, over these last months, we are very encouraged, pleased with the uptake that we see in second-line, where we are the only approved regimen for patients and especially in the community setting that offers a very attractive opportunity for patients and for healthcare professional. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the transition going into second-line, where we also expect treatment durations to be longer in line with the long-term data that we are sharing. As for the usage before and after [CAR-T] [Ph] I think that Malte perhaps give us a bit more color and share with more color there."

We actually see Monjuvi used before and after CAR-T treatment, which I think also make sense from a scientific and clinical data perspective. We have -- we are in the process of also sharing data regarding the CD19 expression. So that we can gain confidence inside and also outside that the CD19 target actually remains intact upon longer-term treatment with Monjuvi. So that's a very important information, but in the real words sketching as you asked, we are actually quite contend and also excited that's doctors use Monjuvi before and also after CAR-T treatment."

One further clarification question on the guidance, and so, is with any Monjuvi revenue coming out of Europe also in form as a loyalty included in this guidance at all. And that would be my first question. And the second question is on Monjuvi market launch in U.S. Is it fair to assume that I interpret your comments with regards to the impact of the Corona as well as the winter storms in U.S. that, that March, April, maybe also May might also be more complicated quarters in terms of the launch. And that's my second question. And my last question on Tremfya royalties and then the moderate year-on-year growth you have included in your guidance for 2021. And the product was also approved in Europe for psoriatic arthritis. Is that now a more normal growth rate or the status of that product or why is that not stronger? Thank you."

Look, as we said several times during the COVID at early days, and we launched in the middle of the pandemic. So we've focusing on execution on the launch, but I mean, bearing in mind that we are so focused also on and looking the long-term potential of Monjuvi. And you wanted a couple of examples this morning with [indiscernible]. We have so many opportunities with the pipeline, Monjuvi as a backbone, Monjuvi as a [indiscernible] product, felzartamab, earlier R&D and obviously potential external of proximity. So, I'll encourage you to stay tune and hang with us as we're navigating the context, but it doesn't affect the long-term perspective Monjuvi in our opinion."

So, I think your first question was, have we baked in any royalty revenue from potential EU sales of Monjuvi, and the answer is simply is no. Obviously when that event happens we'll have greater certainty. Your other question was with regard to Tremfya growth, and I just referring slide 16 where we've characterized it as we expect moderate growth. And I think your question is why not more. Well, simply I think definitions of moderate vary, but certainly this is not something we want to be aggressive on because we receive as much information as you do with regard to Tremfya sales up there. And obviously, in 2020 it did $1.3 billion, so it's blockbuster status. The year before, $1 billion, and it seems like with the amount of studies our partner is conducting and the footprint expansion for Tremfya, this continues to have a runway. But it's certainly is not something we have tremendous visibility into. And again, we do not receive any detailed forecast from our partner. And we are working with as much information that is available to the public. And this is not something that the company needs to be super aggressive on."

Is there anything that's relevant from studies, for example, [with toxin] [Ph] or steroids that you point us to as a benchmark for Proteinuria response? And then, follow-up, Jean-Paul, just at the beginning of our prepared comments, you talked about bispecific is important to the long-term strategy.

4247,en,1,1345,1,0.378621,positive,1,positive,0.352426,"So, let me start with the first question on M-PLACE. Yes, we are of course monitoring the autoantibody titers in conjunction with Proteinuria data. And as you may know, the Proteinuria data come roughly six to nine months after you see the first drop in autoantibody titers, that's just by normal process of how kidney reacts to the disappearance of the pathogenic autoantibody. So that's why we hope to have as many data for Proteinuria as possible. But we certainly have immunological data and for proportion of patients for sure are supported by Proteinuria data. With respect to the comparison or benchmarking too, we took them up that's actually quite difficult to make sort of a cross product comparison because recall that in our trail -- in the M-PLACE trial, a significant focus is on patients who would have almost zero probability to respond to tafasitamab because they have such high autoantibody titer. So, that's a difficult situation to give a good benchmarking comparison. But I think with respect to the anecdotal information we receive from other anti-CD38 antibodies in similar diseases and with respect to what we have seen in our multiple myeloma studies regarding autoantibody production, antibody production, we are really confident and optimistic that we actually score extremely high and have a very competitive product."

We have a series of candidates actually in our research pipeline, bispecific -- novel generation of bispecific, the Hemibody technology on [Phase] [Ph] and the CyCAT platform.

But there's no doubt that long term potential for underground operations at Salobo does exist, is just we still got I think, 20 plus 30 plus years of reserves in front of us, even with the expansion throughput there.

Continuing on the theme at Salobo here, with this next opportunity on the stockpiling is there any sort of timeline that you can provide in terms of when we could expect and update and ingest maybe from a technical perspective, is there anything to prevent the company from making this decision at a later date versus before the expansion is finished."

The first one just Voisey's Bay, I wonder if he might just be able to put a bit more meat on the bones of what you could potentially kind of realize in terms of production levels, just on the various meals. I appreciate, it's quite difficult necessarily to have a full picture there. But would you be able to give us any kind of sort of stare on the various sort of three and four expansion, what that could take production levels to?"

4464,en,1,95,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Well, what I can tell you is the amount of tonnes that each one of those expansions relates to."
4465,en,1,289,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.73369,"Currently, the mine is running at around a 60,000 tonne per day capacity. The Phase 3 will take it from 60,000 to 90,000 tonnes per day. And the Phase 4, the proposed Phase 4, it's not definite yet by any means. But it sure looks like it's shaping up will be another 30,000 tonnes per day."
4466,en,1,396,1,0.64501,positive,,positive,0.64501,"So, it will take the mine ultimately from currently 60,000 tonnes per day to 120,000 tonnes per day, which still, when you look at copper mines around the world, is a large open pit copper mines around the world, it's not the largest in the world by any means is that's a pretty normal operating rate. And in fact, very similar to what we see at Peñasquito where there's even higher strip ratios."
4467,en,1,426,1,-0.856402,negative,,negative,-0.848025,"So now the question is, what grade do they choose and stockpiling and it's very tough. I mean, we know that currently, right now, they are stockpiling lower grade material. They have been ever since, they started up the back in 2012. And setting aside the lower grade material and building up a low-grade stockpile, which will ultimately at the very end of the mine life be processed through the mill. And they are doing that."
4468,en,1,421,1,0.496282,positive,,positive,0.513779,"And so current production levels sort of do reflect the stockpiling approach. Now we know that, it’s easy for us to forecast and in fact, that's what we have included in our long-term forward forecasts is assuming that they process all ore mined through the mill and do not stockpiling and stop stockpiling. And we feel that that's a very conservative base case, we feel there's definitely outside of over and above that."
4469,en,1,438,1,-0.341358,negative,1,negative,-0.40788,"However, the quantum of the amount of material that they stockpile, if they keep on using the same practices they have right now, you would imply that there's a possibility of some of a 50% increase this time around. But there's it's just not going to be like that. Typically, when you scale up in terms of capacity throughputs any crossover grades for stockpiling will drop a bit as you sort of adapt to that higher capacity to the mill."

But they just, it's tough for us to put any more guidance on it other than the fact that we're confident that it'll be higher than what we've got in our corporate forecast. But the quantum higher really does come down to how much material they decide to set aside in the stockpiling campaign material, they decided to move it through the mill."
4471,en,1,432,1,0.628622,positive,,positive,0.86941,"And it is an entire spectrum of results, that it's very flexible on their side. What I can, again, reinforces the fact that not only do we feel it makes economic sense for the continued stockpiling, but there is a pretty healthy incentive, as Gary mentioned earlier on, but $100 million incentive over and above their expensive payment if they commit to continuous stockpiling program and focus our grade materials through the mill."
4472,en,1,262,1,0.302559,positive,1,negative,-0.361295,"And so, so the combination of strong economic -- stronger economics plus that incentive, we do hope that they make the decision, but in the end, it's Vale’s decision as to their approach there.

And even if they're not successful in appealing the recent decision, they do have the opportunity to try and shift the operations on the privately owned land, and move forward, it would be a smaller scale operation that really doesn't make sense.

Could you just maybe briefly talk a little bit about the relationship between the copper and the gold? And how if you're going to see sustained higher copper prices, does that work towards Vale making a decision either one way or the other on the stockpiling issue in terms of the expansion?"
4506,en,1,15,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Randy Smallwood
4507,en,1,706,1,0.7588,positive,,positive,0.779557,"There's no doubt it has an impact on that because they get 100% of the copper revenue and about 25% of the gold revenue. So, the higher copper prices will definitely incentivize them to push that forward. There is on a more global corporate basis down there, Vale has a very continually every time you ever see them present, if they're constantly focused on trying to expand their presence in base metals. They have a lot of exposure to iron ore and it’s a continual message that the expectation is to try and double the contribution from the base metals division of Vale. And Salobo, Salobo 4 is continually referenced. I was at a panel discussion around this week, where the BDAC where it was referenced."
4508,en,1,173,1,0.909833,positive,,positive,0.909833,"And so, we do think that stronger copper prices even provide more incentive for them to go down this path and try and reap some of the benefits of these copper prices today."

4544,en,1,1051,1,0.584546,positive,1,positive,0.621139,"Thank you, Kettina, and thank you, everybody, for attending today. After several years of detailed work and lots of successful exploration, last year, we completed the Keno Hill silver district permitting process and began moving the district back into mining operations. 2020 was pivotal for the company and certainly a challenging year to move a mine into production. For sure, more than one person has commented to me that making a decision to move to production in the middle of a pandemic might have been a dubious decision. We certainly misread the severity of the second wave in Q4 as borders locked down and isolation requirements were reinstituted. But thanks to the professional and determined attributes of our workforce and response and support from YG, from the Yukon government, we have been successfully navigating the restrictions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our progress is slowed. There are certainly added costs, but we are most definitely moving forward towards establishing ourselves as the only primary Canadian silver miner."
4545,en,1,364,1,0.64153,positive,,positive,0.659417,"I should start by summarizing our achievements in 2020 before discussing our outlook for 2021 and our expectation for Keno Hill's longer-term future. On the operations front, in February, we sold our environmental business, AEG, to the AEG management for a total consideration of $13.4 million. This allowed us to focus all of our resources to our mining business."
4546,en,1,633,1,-0.921911,negative,,negative,-0.86082,"In June, following the receipt of the draft water license, we announced our decision to move Keno Hill to production by restarting mining operations at the Bellekeno mine and advancing the Flame  Moth and Bermingham deposits into development and ultimately operation. By August, we were hard on the recruiting trail and scaling up our surface facilities. And in October, we started drilling and blasting underground ore at Bellekeno. All of our production at Bellekeno is long hole in all blocks which had previously been overcut and undercut. Ore from Bellekeno was stockpiled and used for the initial mill commissioning in Q4 2020."
4547,en,1,235,1,0.586026,positive,,positive,0.586026,"And just anecdotally, that's why silver grades have certainly exceeded the mine's ore [old] [ph] block model grades. And we expect the Bellekeno underground mining operations will extend into Q2 2021, longer than initially anticipated."
4548,en,1,237,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Underground development at Bermingham and Flame  Moth started in Q3 2020, and production at Bermingham is scheduled to start in Q2 2021, following completion of the new prime re-ventilation raise, which is about 40% complete as we speak."
4549,en,1,407,1,0.673503,positive,,positive,0.673503,"In Q4, we were faced with the additional COVID-19 restrictions. And as I previously mentioned, this affected our hiring program. And that, along with slower commissioning of new underground equipment, led us to a decision to temporarily suspend underground work at Flame  Moth and focus all of our efforts, at least temporarily, at Bermingham, along with continuing ore production from Bellekeno, of course."
4550,en,1,303,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"In the district mill, modifications completed in Q4 2020 included the installation of cyclones, a new filter press and modifications to the final feeder. We undertook the initial commissioning runs at the mill in November and processed about 300 tonnes of Bellekeno ore, producing our first concentrate."
4551,en,1,754,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"Staying with the mill, construction of a new building around the crusher was completed in Q1 2021, and the installation of a new ventilation system in the crushing facility is scheduled for completion in Q2 2021. The mill continues to operate on a 2 and 2 basis as other mechanical adjustments and circuit modifications mainly focused on metallurgical performance are ongoing and continued during this mill commissioning stage. Through the end of February 2021, we have produced a total of more than 2,400 tonnes of ore from Bellekeno with silver head grades and recoveries of 956 grams per tonne silver and 92%, respectively. Both of these are above plan. The first lead-silver concentrate and zinc concentrate shipments were dispatched in January 2021."
4552,en,1,651,1,0.743912,positive,,positive,0.727714,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained strict health and safety and social distancing measures and kept our workforce and our community safe. However, as I previously mentioned, the effects of these measures on workforce schedules, recruitment, onboarding and training, especially our new underground equipment, has been slowed by both the COVID-related restrictions and the variable ground conditions primarily attributable to innovated quartzite and schist, which the operator is a steadily gaining experience. We expect that as COVID-19 restrictions ease over the coming months, we'll see further operational improvements."
4553,en,1,535,1,0.645516,positive,,positive,0.490858,"On the exploration front. Our 2020 surface exploration program confirmed the presence of high-grade silver mineralization first discovered in 2018 below the existing Bermingham deposit. Last year's drilling focused on a structurally controlled sub-horizontal mineralized zone, which has traced over 500 meters along strike and a series of wide step-outs, which results generally in the 5- to 18-meter true thickness range in terms of the mineralization, which generally contain between 1,500 and more than 3,000 grams per tonne silver."
4554,en,1,253,1,0.798378,positive,,positive,0.798378,"In total, we completed 7,600 meters focused along the structurally controlled sub-horizontal zone. And this year, beginning -- as we speak here, we're anticipating about 25,000 meters of directionally controlled drilling to infill the work done in 2020."
4555,en,1,667,1,0.760107,positive,,neutral,0.0,"Finally, in 2020, ERDC advanced the reclamation project to offset historic liabilities in the district. And in July of 2020, the YESAB environmental and socioeconomic assessment board has issued a final decision document on the final valuation report. And ERDC has now entered into the Water Boards -- Yukon Water Boards licensing process to obtain the final water license to authorize the activities necessary to begin the closure of the district's historic liabilities. After licensing, the reclamation plan will be finalized for submission to the Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada for approval prior to execution of the final reclamation plan."
4556,en,1,556,1,0.390466,positive,1,positive,0.427226,"On the financial and corporate front, and just to quickly run through some of the metrics in our filings yesterday. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported an operating loss of $22.3 million, much of which is due to increased mine-related expense at Bellekeno and upgrades elsewhere in preparation for the commissioning and start-up activity. We finished 2020 with cash and cash equivalents of $23.7 million and net working capital of $15.4 million. We also ended 2020 with $3.9 million in restricted cash and deposits related to our surety bond."
4557,en,1,538,1,0.674088,positive,,positive,0.640184,"Finally, during 2020, we completed 2 equity financings for a total of $38.6 million, which, of course, were largely directed to start-up -- which are largely being directed to start-up activity. More recently and subsequent to year-end 2020, we sold our NSR royalty in Golden Predator's Brewery Creek project for $4.5 million in cash. And on January 28, 2021, we issued 2.7 million shares and completed an equity financing for total gross proceeds of $11.7 million, the majority of which will fund our large exploration program this year."
4558,en,1,335,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,"In 2021, we're focused on ramping up to design throughput of 400 tonnes per day through the mill. Thus far, we have been operating the mill on a modified schedule to match ore delivery from Bellekeno and to optimize metallurgical performance of our improved flow sheet, including the modified grinding, classifying and filter circuits."
4559,en,1,580,1,-0.80444,negative,,negative,-0.80444,"With the ore mill feed transitioning to Bermingham sourced ore in Q2 2021, ore production at Flame  Moth beginning in Q3 2021 and provided that we're not required to further expand our current COVID-19 protocols, we are cheered to expect nameplate capacity of 400 tonnes per day through the mill in Q3 of this year. I would say quite confidently that our primary risk in this commissioning and scale-up process is still the COVID risk, meaning that further border and/or site restrictions resulting from any resurgence of the virus will be increasingly difficult for us to handle."
4560,en,1,347,1,0.941859,positive,,positive,0.787798,"At the same time, we're working on an updated technical report for an updated mineral resource and reserve estimate that we expect to release in Q2 2021. This report will incorporate a modified mine plan based on our operational experience to date as well as meaningfully improved silver prices since we published our last mine plan in early 2020."
4561,en,1,432,1,0.764315,positive,,positive,0.774044,"Finally and just to reiterate, we are mobilizing our exploration team as we speak, planning to begin immediately to drill off the Bermingham Northeast deep mineralization. We'll be utilizing 4 drill rigs with directional drilling technology to focus on infill drilling and extension of mineralization with the intention to upgrade the Bermingham mineral resource estimate towards year-end when exploration results will be available."
4562,en,1,544,1,0.960637,positive,,positive,0.963584,"The restart of operations at Keno Hill has coincided with strong silver prices and puts us in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities existing in our historic silver-rich district and to generate value for our shareholders. We intend to do this by maximizing all of our existing resources, maintaining a laser-like focus on commissioning and scale-up activities to achieve design throughput and a 4 million-ounce per year silver run rate while also executing perhaps the most important exploration program we have ever conducted."
4563,en,1,181,1,0.992333,positive,,positive,0.992333,"I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we get closer to commercial production, and I thank our shareholders for their continued support and confidence in our team."
4564,en,1,320,1,0.9717,positive,,positive,0.9717,"Finally, I want to reiterate that we owe a debt of thanks to our employees who have soldiered on through pretty rigorous COVID-related operating protocols and also to the Yukon government and health officials who have worked hand-in-hand with us to ensure that we can continue to operate through this challenging period."

4570,en,1,170,1,0.622362,positive,,positive,0.781903,We saw grades well above plan in the initial material that went through the mill. Was this a one-off or should we expect to see elevated grades from Bellekeno through Q2?

4572,en,1,743,1,0.588682,positive,1,positive,0.571346,"Yes. Good morning Jake, and thanks for the question. Yes, we're carrying a certain block -- we carry a block model at Bellekeno. It just happens that there's 2 primary stopes that are being mined there over the course of the next couple of months -- will be completed in the next couple of months. Certainly, the first one has overachieved its block model grades, and that would not be unexpected in a deposit the style of Bellekeno. We're working pretty centrally located in the deposit. The second stope, you will have to wait until we get it through the mill to see what the grades might be. But yes, I mean, Bellekeno is going to overachieve both in terms of -- relative to the block model in terms of grade and probably tonnes. We'll see."

4574,en,1,380,1,0.830336,positive,,positive,0.906254,"Okay. That's helpful. And then just on exploration. Obviously, it's a big focus this year with the 25,000-meter program in the Bermingham resource update that you mentioned later this year. How should we be thinking about that updated resource relative to the existing mine plan? I mean do you think we could see an updated mine plan sometime next year after that resource is out?"

4576,en,1,526,1,0.512664,positive,1,positive,0.505737,"Yes. That's a decision that we're going to have to discuss at Alexco, obviously. I'd rather -- I think we'd rather sort of wait and take this step by step. Let's get this drilling done and the resource, assuming that the drilling is successful, get any resource put together in that deeper area. And then we'll decide whether or not we should modify mine plan, which is already being modified, as I mentioned, at Bermingham to see whether or not we can accommodate any additional resources should there be any [at depth] [ph]."
4577,en,1,249,1,0.58709,positive,1,positive,0.623889,"So yes, it's a good question. We have not made that decision yet. But I would expect that if the drilling is successful, I mean, we'll be pretty keen to try and figure out what value would be added by incorporation of that additional mineralization."

4581,en,1,274,1,-0.734948,negative,,negative,-0.734948,"I guess first thing, given the impacts of COVID and a little bit of delays there, what should we think about as far as staging of production over the remainder of the year? Is there kind of a range you can give us of what tonnes per day might look like on a quarterly basis?"
4582,en,1,14,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Clynton Nauman
4583,en,1,608,1,0.276671,positive,1,negative,-0.279579,"I mean Brad might want to chime in here but, I mean, generally, Joe, we're thinking that we're going through this commissioning process, we definitely need to onboard more plant-related or mill-related people and to spool that mill up to a more consistent operating basis. I mean right now it's operating on a 2 and 2 basis. So we -- I mean we would -- I think we'd be reluctant to put specific tonnes and grade in the commissioning process other than our target, which is to achieve 400 tonnes through the mill in Q4 -- in Q3, sorry, of this year. I mean, Brad, do you have anything you want to add to that?"
4584,en,1,14,1,-0.724394,negative,,negative,-0.724394,Bradley Thrall
4585,en,1,472,1,0.798923,positive,,positive,0.7005,"No. I think you did -- again, in general, there's -- we have a reasonably sized inventory of ore at Bellekeno. And then as Bermingham -- we're projected to hit our first ore horizon at Bermingham in Q2. And then you start to combine those together and then Flame  Moth a little bit later on. So yes, it's a gradual ramp-up period. We're continuing to kind of update our schedules and mine plans as we go along here. So I think that's the best we can see it for the moment."

4587,en,1,191,1,-0.781502,negative,1,positive,0.310359,"Okay. Fair enough. On the note of the ramp-up, is there a certain tonnes-per-day average you need to get to in order to start treating the production as revenue instead of an offset to CapEx?"

4589,en,1,189,1,0.0,neutral,,positive,0.664922,"I'm going to ask Mike Clark to chime in on that because I think we are early adopting -- the plan is to early adopt the commercial production, whatever you call it, language. Mike, can you?"

4591,en,1,468,1,0.771066,positive,1,positive,0.698948,"Yes. Thanks, Clynt. Joe, yes, we are planning to early adopt, which means we'll start recognizing revenues immediately and cost of sales. And so starting in January 2021, all the revenues from Bellekeno we'll be recognizing. And then as Bermingham starts up in Q2, followed by Flame in Q3, you're going to start seeing all that revenue hit the P&L immediately with these -- so we won't be offsetting the mineral properties for revenues. Does that answer your question?"
4592,en,1,13,1,0.0,neutral,,neutral,0.0,Joseph Reagor
4593,en,1,178,1,0.763363,positive,,positive,0.752068,"Okay. Yes, that makes it a lot easier, too. All right. And then last thing, remaining capital spend between now and reaching that 400 tonnes per day, what's it kind of look like?"

4597,en,1,549,1,0.839325,positive,,positive,0.800703,"Yes, well, there's a couple of different buckets of capital, Joe. I mean we've got our PP&E capital just to finish up most of -- a few of these capital projects, the second grinding mill, a couple of concentrate regrind mills. So I would put that in a bucket of PP&E capital. And that's a relatively modest number, $1.5 million to $2 million, to finish up those projects. But then you obviously have the working capital to continue to -- as we continue to ramp up and reach kind of steady state and positive revenue, I mean, that's a period as well."

Again, similar to your previous question, I think we're kind of continuing to undergo our -- kind of our updated, I guess, mine plans. But again, the PP&E capital is relatively low, but it's the working capital until we get to that positive -- to that point where it's cash flow positive, which is into that Q3 range with all 3 mines running."

Yes, I mean I think in general, the Yukon -- I mean where the Yukon sits today, there does continue to be a -- the borders are closed. So anybody that comes into the Yukon, even if you're a Yukon resident, you do have to quarantine for 14 days. To date, there's been 75 cases of COVID in the Yukon. There's no -- currently no active cases. There hasn't been a reported case at any of the three mines, as you know, between Alexco, those 2 other operating mines in the Yukon. There hasn't been a reported case at all 3 of those. And the Yukon is doing pretty well on their vaccination rates. I believe they are leading Canada in terms of the percent of the population."

And it will be more focused on the vertical extent of mineralization versus the horizontal extent, which we focused on in 2020. That being said, we will certainly drill more holes to the Southwest, where we currently understand the mineralization to be. To the Northeast, probably not so much. We know where the Northeast termination or offset of that mineralization is. And it would, in fact, not reappear until we're into Hector-Calumet proper."

And then when you look at the other geometry of the veins and how they come together, that it kind of pinches out. But I don't know if -- my mind says that's not necessarily so because you're above the Hector-Calumet, which was historically quite thick. But as the -- get to the bottom of the terminus of the scheduled mine plant at Bermingham, you're getting to that area that really has the best silver grades and the highest lead grades. And I'm just wondering if you're going to be targeting under that area because wondering if that's a shoot or a feeder or something like that."

We feel that there's a certain structural intersection that we have identified -- that the geologists have identified at Bermingham. And we are following that -- the projection of that structural intersection along to the Northeast. And that structure and dissection persists all the way up through the Bellekeno, the Bermingham deposit itself and is the locus for mineralization."

But I just have the sense that you're going to execute a well -- a step-up of operations, but the exploration here this year could be another pivot for you. And that the ending of the year is going to be quite interesting when you look back on the last couple of years. So those are just my questions and comments."

And it goes back to Jake's question earlier, which was -- okay, so you're assuming that there's mineralization in this new area. What are you going to do in terms of the mine plan and future development? And those are the things that we at Alexco have to figure out. And I once again go back to the step-by-step progression, which is let's drill it first, figure out what we are looking at and then go the next step."

You mentioned that the workers are subject to a 14-day quarantine. Did the workers, mining personnel that are there on site, can they leave? Are they leaving and going vacation and not coming back? Are new ones coming in? And does being -- can working in the mine include being quarantined? In other words, how hamstrung are you?"

So we are able to bring in employees from outside the Yukon right to the mine site. And they can work, but they must quarantine at the end of their day. So at the end of a typical 12-hour day, all employees need to go back to the room. They can't leave their room. Meals are brought to them. They can't use the recreation facilities. We have to keep all of our Yukon employees separated from non-Yukon employees. And that means separate charters to site, separate buses, separate vehicle transportation. We have a full-time nurse on site. So we do daily checks every morning. We have part of our camp that's been isolated off for an isolation unit in case there is -- anybody even gets a sniffle, we pull them out of the main population."

And when this was first -- when the Yukon government in early November first reimplemented or reinstituted these travel restrictions, we probably lost a couple of rotations that we had to stand down, if you will, our employees. We just needed time to respond and put new plans together. So hopefully, that gives you kind of an overview of how we're trying to manage this."

I guess the first point, obviously really impressive step down in SG&A year-over-year and on a fairly similar base of revenue. So when we look at the savings when you think about labor facility costs, professional fees, what do you think is permanent and what may come back this year as volume picks up?"

However, as we've mentioned before, as we start growing and adding top line, we will be bringing back additional people into our sales force as we see opportunity to really be able to capitalize on that. I think we've got a fair amount of room in our back office to not have to bring on additional support to support more revenue, but certainly on the revenue sales side, I think there's some opportunity there that we'll take advantage of and make sure that we're doing what we can out in the field."

I think on the last call, you quantify that revenue per employee increased, I think, like, a third in the U.S. I was just -- any thoughts you have around your current [indiscernible] recruiter bench and the existing capacity? How much is left there before you have to meaningfully add headcount?"

4731,en,1,1269,1,0.701275,positive,1,positive,0.67885,"Yes, so I'll pick that one, Josh. We -- it varies, right. So the answer to that really varies depending upon what location, what area of the country, the specific dynamic that may be happening in any one particular location. We look at productivity, we look at it regularly. It's a metric that we measure to, it's a metric that our folks are incented by. So it's a very important metric for us. And we know that a certain productivity level in teams hit the glass ceiling, and they just simply cannot, cannot grow. And when we see that approaching, we're very quick to make an investment, right? We're making investments as we win new business, as we win new on site, as we're seeing a lot of our clients expand and buying activity pick up. So -- and then in other areas, we still have significant bandwidth, where those productivity levels are lower, might be more of a startup branch, or might be an area where we're just really looking to leverage. So it varies, but it is something that we monitor very closely. What we will continue to do, to Herb's point, is certainly look for additional cost savings opportunities, as we leverage technology and identify cost savings. And some of that will be offset by investments that will continue to make to fuel the growth."

Our team has gotten up to speed, very, very quickly, both from an accounting and shared service side. We've got metrics on their performance, and they continue to come in excellent. We've had a few people that haven't worked out, as you have in any situation, and we've dealt with that situation quickly. And have really been very pleased. We went through, we've got a fair amount of accounting support there. We just went through our year-end audit last, December, and it was one of the cleanest audits we've had, we just had Q1 and Q1 was done, extremely well. So we're very pleased. Going forward, we're continuing to look, is there an opportunity or not certainly any time that we have a position that opens up through attrition or whatever, we evaluate. Does it make sense for us to replace that position in India or do we need to do it here, and we're handling that by case by case basis."

If I heard you right, Herb you said, you expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In Q2 -- okay, great.

And then the other thing is the supply chain interruption. So we actually saw cutbacks in states that were not affected by the ice storms, but indirectly because they couldn't get the [indiscernible] the supply chain was disrupted. And we're still seeing a little bit of impact from that. And that's part of kind of the range, and if that doesn't recover quickly, you'll see us on the low end of that range. If it rebounds quickly, and you've got things making up, we could do a little bit better, but we -- overall, it hasn't been horrendous, but also keep in mind, that you've not only had the big ice storm that hit Texas and Tennessee, but before that you also had really bad weather in the Northeast, the Midwest, has been getting hit, Denver, just got [indiscernible]. So that's something -- that is something we're watching closely, but right now there's an impact there 1% to 2% potentially, but knock on wood, not much more than that."

And that's currently shown now as a current liability. And then going into the following year, you've got another just a hair under $13 million that will be due at the end of 2022. And then as far as the 3% mixers, multiple components of that: one, is the retail that we just talked about and ultimately striving to get that to the 30% of our business and then growth in our Direct Hire, as a key priority for us now. And then, the other major third leg of that is just better pricing, through our existing business and new business continuing to get better margins and better pricing on what we do as well as overall cost control."

Comparable sales were remarkable 13.8%, representing the best Q4 comp we have ever achieved. Our e-commerce business continues to grow at a pace significantly faster than our stores; however, due to the small base, the overwhelming majority of our comps still comes from our stores."

Notably, our Bronx, New York store performed in the top 25 holiday grand openings even with the more restrictive environment and reduced marketing.

4826,en,1,497,1,0.755825,positive,,positive,0.759746,"Regarding the internal factors, from a merchandising perspective, the trend-right amazing value products in our stores resonated with our customers. We saw broad based strength throughout the store, especially in our room, style, sports, and tech worlds. The trends related COVID we experienced throughout the year continued. Room and tech benefited from the work and play-at-home trend, while style captured the direct COVID impact of customers buying masks and hand sanitizers among other items."

We accomplished so much during 2020, while quickly pivoting to adapt to the new environment and new ways of working. None of this would have been possible without our incredible team, who I am so personally proud of. Their agility, grit, and resilience enabled us to close and safely reopen our entire fleet of existing stores in record pace as well as complete our new store opening plans and achieve our 1,000-store milestone."

Allow me to elaborate. First, as it relates to product, it all starts with the WOW factor that is our customer promise. Innovation and agility are core to Five Below. Adjusting to customer needs and new trends is what Five Below does very well, as we demonstrated during COVID."
4842,en,1,364,1,0.808588,positive,,positive,0.831178,"Let me give you a little more color on what we are doing with Five Beyond and product collaborations.

While our Localhost test was temporarily interrupted by COVID, we will restart this initiative to continue to add more Localhost locations in 2021.

As you mentioned, it is going to be an unusual year anniversarying 2020, but our impression and our -- what we see here from a leverage point, going forward, we have said before about a 3% comp, ex any meaningful investment for a year, and you should start to see leverage on the business.

And that's an external factor that if there's any change in policy, in mandates out there or benefits from taxes. We have seen historically that that could benefit our business to an increase, because normally, that's an increase overall traffic or spending. And we benefit in that, similar to what we've seen in the second round of stimulus, and currently in the third round of stimulus. So yes, if the rules change, that way, it could end up impacting our traffic during the summer time."

And I do, but hopefully, everyone's taken away is, we provide you our new stores, which make up historically 80% of our growth. You know the cadence on them, how we're thinking about the bottom-line and growth rates. And so, it starts to triangulate it in a pretty predictable number."

If you could show some more colors on inventory levels, you exited the quarter down 13%. Would you say that hindered your ability to capture some sales in the fourth quarter, and you had to leave some on the table.

And again, a couple things were going on there. One, you got to look at last year when we were up probably half of that related to the sales and then also we moved inventory in earlier, tariff related inventory to avoid some tariffs there. And then you kind of flip to this year when we oversold right and had some a tremendous sell throughs there in the fourth quarter."

Because there's actually two components at this point in time. There's the Five Beyond prototype, and then there's what we affectionately call the Wow Wall that's in the rest of the chain. And so, our go forward prototype for the class of '21 will -- for the most part, all new stores and remodels will now incorporate Five Beyond in the back of the store."

And I want to walk really carefully with not violating that agreement we have with the customer, namely Five the World.

I mean, 30% of our chain will now have the Five Beyond prototype at the end of year. And so that's the nice balance with it. We'll watch it. Could it change over time? Maybe.

But I think what we also learned is where we were heading done a pretty strong path of national TV the consumer behavior shifted a lot.

Taking the back half of that on the D.C. side, in theory, when the next one is up, it certainly gives us the capacity to support all 2,500 stores. Now that doesn't mean you'll never hear us open another distribution center, because at some point in time, you also look at efficiencies and you want a smaller regional and say the Pacific Northwest or something. But our overwhelming heavy lift, multi-year investment phase to which we were honestly kind of behind them, we're now ahead.

It's a big part of our focus. We're laser-focused on it. We know that the core is as important as any of the growth that we have in emerging and expansion markets. There's a little bit of noise in the Q4 just from some holiday overlaps, some channel exposure, heavier exposure to C-store under penetration in mass in some of those core markets, so it's a hotchpotch of different reasons, but it still grew almost 6%."

And so we're putting a laser focus on that. And just very importantly, our overarching objectives are that we want to gain share in our core.

So maybe a little more color on how we arrive, where we did? And so maybe just to help guide that question along. Can Truco for instance or On The Border specifically grow in 2021? And are we thinking about those core markets just being pressured by the COVID comp and that's just fully offset by expansion in emerging market share?

We expect distribution gains which are meaningful as we've been building over time and going to your point about emerging and expansion that will continue to grow and outpace the category and we expect the core to do well as well.

You mentioned price pack architecture and also depth and frequency of promo, to what extent will list prices -- list price increases also be in that formula?"
5268,en,1,417,1,0.738516,positive,,positive,0.810702,"And secondly, I wanted a little more depth on, ON THE BORDER. And it seems like there's significant revenue synergy opportunities with your Utz distribution platform. Are your Utz salespeople marketing that brand to their customers currently and has that yielded more distribution, or is ON THE BORDER’s stand-alone business -- is it still, kind of, operating stand-alone and it has its own distribution plan? Thanks."

5270,en,1,706,1,0.642715,positive,,positive,0.63376,"Yeah. Robert, I'm going to tackle both of those. This is Dylan. I could probably give you 30 minutes on either one of those topics, but I'll try to do it in succinct way. In terms of pricing, in the snacking industry it's a little bit different. It's not just your typical list pricing initiatives. However, we have a very robust price pack architecture team that constantly analyzes the opportunities like I mentioned earlier about frequency, about depth. We did just do some pricing on March 8th, which kicked in. Of course, it takes a little while for some of that to flow through the system with contracts and all the specifics of the thousands of accounts that we basically deal with on a daily basis."
5271,en,1,342,1,0.432814,positive,,positive,0.554595,So we do have some list and then we also have some weighed-out opportunities that we're enacting and some different things around that to really try to tackle offsetting some of the inflation concerns. So on that we have a lot of different levers. We're pulling all the levers and we're going to continue to lean into those levers on pricing.
5272,en,1,577,1,0.794317,positive,,positive,0.816879,"Flipping to your commentary about ON THE BORDER and the integration of sales and how that works. As we said at the very beginning, we did not look at ON THE BORDER as a cost synergy play from an M&A perspective. We looked at it as a revenue synergy play from an M&A perspective. So that team continues to sell day-in and day-out to their major customers on a DTW, direct-to-warehouse basis. That's impact that's going very well, they have great leadership, they have a great team. If you think about it, we're months into it right now. We're coalescing very well on all fronts."
5273,en,1,575,1,0.362741,positive,,positive,0.797013,"Our sales folks it's a little bit -- you have to unwind in some cases existing distribution and there's some complications there that you just have to unwind with any integration of M&A. But, for example, in Chicago like within weeks of the acquisition being consummated, we were taking it through our route system, through our third-party distributor route system in Chicago into June [ph]. For example, in Central Pennsylvania, we've already turned over OTB distribution to the Utz DSD sales system. In Connecticut, we've already turned it over to the Utz DSD sales system."
5274,en,1,359,1,0.609236,positive,1,positive,0.611063,"And so as we look forward, those opportunities are going to I think be very positive and very accretive to us because the brand sells and it's doing really well in the places that we've been able to convert it. And when it is distributed, when it is sold, if you think about the sales team at OTB, I would garner to say there's, roughly eight people in sales."
5275,en,1,246,1,-0.607763,negative,,negative,-0.554253,"When you think about the sales team at Utz, I would garner to say, if you disregard the DSD sales force we still have over 200-plus people that sell. So all of them are looking at OTB, and it's not just tortillas, its sauces, its dips, its cases."

A couple of quick housekeeping questions, first, you mentioned contracts and the step-up to 4% inflation from modestly deflationary. Is that going to be a gradual ease in sort of giving you time to adjust if the productivity ramping, or are your rollover a cliff it had a little bit of friction on margins, as we enter the year?"

5289,en,1,344,1,0.922113,positive,,positive,0.931266,"Yeah. So in the digital and social area, we are spending approximately 60% more in 2021, than 2020. Part of that is incremental dollars for sure, part of that is also pulling out of sponsorship and moving the mix, into more digital and social. So it's a significant increase that we are going to layer into that digital social, in pure dollars."
