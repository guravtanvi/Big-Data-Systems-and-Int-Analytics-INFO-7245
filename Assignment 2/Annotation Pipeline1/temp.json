And so we\u2019re taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels.

I\u2019m on my, I guess, 14 month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands and frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior \u2013 to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising \u2013 these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it\u2019s quite powerful. And we\u2019re probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example I\u2019ll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they are getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not \u2013 they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home.

Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what\u2019s possible, we\u2019re just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really \u2013 has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that\u2019s all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you\u2019re the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our \u2013 who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that\u2019s even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants.", "score": 0.797317, "mixed": "1", "label": "positive"}], "document": {"score": 0.814015, "label": "positive"}}, "language": "en"}, {"usage": {"text_units": 1, "text_characters": 1375, "features": 1}, "sentiment": {"targets": [{"text": "And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re into our data journey, but there is so much more opportunity to come.

It was the \u2013 I think eighth straight quarter where women\u2019s growth out indexed overall growth. And that\u2019s across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, marketplace retail, grew to high double digits, and we\u2019re gaining share in women\u2019s, both on footwear and apparel. And while we\u2019re seeing success in women\u2019s to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we\u2019ve described with a real dedicated and focused women\u2019s team, means that we can increase our investment. So we\u2019ve doubled our investment in women\u2019s innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier, this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner.

I mean, so yes, Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate, translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you\u2019re beginning to see whether it\u2019s improved and personalized search results, whether you\u2019re seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it\u2019s anticipating timing of when you\u2019re due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it\u2019s what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don\u2019t want people, they don\u2019t want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, and two, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that\u2019s one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we\u2019re going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said, scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is \u2013 it\u2019s true in the technology industry. It\u2019s also true, I think, in our industry, and so we\u2019ll have a scale advantage in data.

The science, the science of what we are doing, it\u2019s been done, it\u2019s doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. It\u2019s the creativity of our apparel designers, of our footwear designers. It\u2019s the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesn\u2019t displace art.

So, it\u2019s a one-to-one and we validated that with some of our customers that have both installed beta of P-50 and have received the P-1. And I think that P-1 is a much small machine. So, it\u2019s easier to install and deploy, but it\u2019s a great platform, it\u2019s going to help us mature that technology to the point where it\u2019s you have got high OEE by the time we deploy your P-50 into the market later this year.

So, I think that depends on the transaction. And we have several things that we are working on. So as we execute them, we would love to explain the opportunity and why we did, what we did and then I think there is a great opportunity in bringing AM 2.0 technologies into the market. One thing that I think is a focus of us is we are not going to do any acquisitions on sort of tooling or take some pictures or things that we would consider AM 1.0. I mean, our market grew in sort of a rapid prototyping tooling type of world and our company is 100% focused on mass production of end use parts. So there is a lot of folks that would like to claim that there is the same thing, but there is sort of two ways of playing this market. One is to take a technology that\u2019s helped patents, for example, like FDM and develop a more modern version of that for smaller markets like tooling and jigs and fixtures. Another one is to really tackle the issue of how do you go to mass production at scale with additive and we are 100% focused on what we call AM 2.0, which is the production of additive parts at scale, at a lower cost structure than conventional manufacturing, where the economics are the driver. So, that\u2019s 100% the focus on the company and all of our M&A strategies and execution focus is geared towards making additive cost effective. The systems cost too much today to bring to market and older technologies is not cost effective on a cost per part basis.

And the last question is on your last slide, you didn't include the Xencor royalty, if you could just clarify where it sits within the Monjuvi P&L?", "score": 0.635549, "mixed": "1", "label": "positive"}], "document": {"score": 0.62138, "label": "positive"}}, "language": "en"}, {"usage": {"text_units": 1, "text_characters": 8, "features": 1}, "sentiment": {"targets": [{"text": "Sung Lee", "score": 0, "label": "neutral"}], "document": {"score": 0, "label": "neutral"}}, "language": "en"}, {"usage": {"text_units": 1, "text_characters": 1200, "features": 1}, "sentiment": {"targets": [{"text": "Sure.

OpEx again, does not include any elements of cost of goods sold or cost of sales. Okay, with regard to your question on the Tafa R&D, I think you were talking about reimbursement the 55:45 split, where we pick up 45% of the development expenses and Incyte balance. I'll have to double-check this, but I believe this formula applies retroactively to a time that's before the effective date of the agreement.
